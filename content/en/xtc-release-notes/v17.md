## XTC v17

### Fixes
- When updating data concurrently, you might have come across an error message saying just "validation.outdated". Now there is a proper error message.
- If the user enters an invalid value for the retry count setting of a monitoring scenario, the form could nevertheless be submitted and the retry count was silently set to 1. Now the form can only be submitted if the retry count is valid.
- When editing time ranges, for example in the scenario execution history, the date-time picker dialog did jump to the upper-left corner of the browser window. Now the dialog stays in place.
