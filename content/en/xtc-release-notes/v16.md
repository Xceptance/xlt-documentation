## XTC v16

### Improvements
- Now the UI performs input validation as you type
    - when editing the profile data in the My Account area
    - when editing the phone number in monitoring notification subscriptions
### Fixes
- When editing the phone number in the account settings, validation errors were not cleared correctly after canceling the phone number editor, so they were still present when opening the editor anew.
- Sporadically, an empty page was shown after creating a new monitoring project.
