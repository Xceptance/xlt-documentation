## XTC v23

### improvements

- On the homepage of a monitoring project, the status of each monitoring scenario is shown including a success rate for the past 24 hours. The **success rate** is now displayed with a higher precision, so an actual rate of 0.999 is now shown as 99.90% instead of being rounded up to 100%.
- The loading of UI components has been improved. In case of a loading error, the UI will no longer show a loading indicator spinning endlessly, but try to reload the component once and display an error message if that fails.
