## XTC v22

### improvements
When running the monitoring scenarios with Chrome/Chromium as the underlying browser, you might have come across an error message in the scenario execution log saying "bind() failed: Cannot assign requested address (99)" and wondered if that error had a negative effect on the monitoring scenario. No, it had not. Nevertheless, the scenario executor is now configured such that this error will not appear any longer.
