## XTC v40.1



### Load Testing
- Fixed an issue when displaying load test reports. For reports that have been created months ago, the report pages show binary content instead of proper HTML.

#### Resource Usage Tracking
When performing load tests, agent machines are started on your behalf to drive the traffic against the system under test. After a load test, both the raw load test results (measurements, error information, etc.) and also the reports generated from the results are saved to a storage device. Both agent machines and storage incur costs. Beginning with this version, XTC records information about machine hours and occupied storage.

This version of XTC provides a new screen *Resource Usage*, which is available from the navigation menu of a load testing project. This screen lists the spent machine hours and occupied storage for this project for your information. Note that this screen is not visible to users with the project role *Reviewer* or *Guest*.

#### Other Important Changes: 
- The editor for regular and secret load test properties has been split into two separate editors, i.e. regular and secret properties are now configured independently from each other.
