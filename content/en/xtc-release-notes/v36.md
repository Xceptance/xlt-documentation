## XTC v36


### Platform
- The organization/project selectors in the header of the client app have been refined.
    - Clicking the controls now opens the dropdown list instead of navigating to the selected org/project.
    - The list of orgs/projects is sorted now.
- All pages have a sub header now which names the current page and provides space for action buttons.
- Some tabs on the Configuration page of a tenant/project have been promoted to top-level pages and can now be found directly in the sidebar.
### Load Testing
- Load tests, results, and reports are all numbered now. This allows referring to a certain load test/result/report more easily.
- When creating a load test report fails, for example, because of an invalid custom command-line option, the report will no longer be pending forever, but will be marked as failed. Furthermore, failed reports can be deleted via the UI.
