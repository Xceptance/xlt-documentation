## Introduction

The _[Posters simple loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-simple-loadtest-suite)_ is our most minimal approach at building a test suite to help you get started with XLT, get used to the concepts and understand how things are supposed to work. It works on our real-world demo application, the _[Posters shop]({{< relref "../quick-start/20-demo-application" >}})_, which you can also find on [Github](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) (or in the _samples_ of your official XLT release). It is a good starting point for beginners, but for real-world problems you'll probably want to move on to a more complex sample. Learn more in the [Quickstart section]({{< relref "../quick-start/30-demo-test-suite" >}}).
