## Google Cloud (GC)

### Setting up gcloud

To start using XLT's **gce_admin** tool for setting up and managing load test instances, you first need to set up your machine to use Google's **gcloud command line tool**. In order to do this, download and install the Cloud SDK for your platform, following the directions <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive" target="_blank">from Google</a>. 

Add the Cloud SDK command-line tools to your PATH and enable command completion if you want to. In any case, restart your shell after the installation and run `gcloud init` to initialize the gcloud environment. This will prompt you to log in using your Google user account - log in (in your browser) and click _Allow_ to grant permission to access Google Cloud resources.

At the command prompt, select a Google Cloud project from the list of those where you have _Owner_, _Editor_ or _Viewer_ permissions:

```dos
Pick cloud project to use:
 [1] [my-project-1]
 [2] [my-project-2]
 ...
 Please enter your numeric choice:
```

If you only have one project, gcloud init selects it for you.

In order to create application default credentials for use by **gce_admin**, run:
```dos
gcloud auth application-default login
```
In the browser, log in and accept the requested permissions.

### Using XLT's gce_admin tool

Before its first usage, the gce_admin tool needs to be configured. You can do this by editing `<XLT>/config/gce_admin.properties`. The most important property you need to set here is the project id, which should be the same project you set earlier in **gcloud**:

```bash
xlt.gce.projectId = my-project-1
```

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service is another perfect fit for on-demand load testing. XLT agents can easily be run from EC2 instances. But without a helpful tool, configuring the master controller to use the new agents can be a tedious job, especially if many agent machines are involved, as it includes to manually get the current IP address of each machine and create a corresponding line in the mastercontrollerâ€™s configuration. XLT ships with a simple command-line tool that simplifies the handling of Amazon EC2 instances in general: the **ec2_admin**. It provides the following functionality:

-   start new instances (with only a few options)
-   stop running instances
-   list running instances (and print a corresponding agent controller configuration ready to be pasted into `mastercontroller.properties`)

Note that this tool is not intended to replace the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS console</a> or similar tools.
