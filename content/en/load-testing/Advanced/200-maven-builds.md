## Integrating XLT into a Maven project

Starting with XLT 5.0.x, XLT is published to <a href="https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.xceptance/xlt" target="_blank">Maven Central</a>. This facilitates updating the XLT version used in test projects. To integrate XLT into your Maven project, copy and paste the following into your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.xceptance</groupId>
        <artifactId>xlt</artifactId>
        <version>5.0.1</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

For versions before XLT 5.0.x, Xceptance offers a public repository hosting all XLT releases, including their corresponding _POM_ files. To configure your test project to use the Xceptance repository, add the following code to your test project's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>xc-nexus</id>
        <url>https://lab.xceptance.de/nexus/content/groups/public</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

When configuring your test project to use a newer XLT version, do not forget to update XLT on your load machines as well. The version youâ€™ve used to develop your test scripts must match the execution version of your load test environment.
