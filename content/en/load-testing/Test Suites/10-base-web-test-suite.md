## Introduction

The [_posters_ simple loadtest suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-simple-loadtest-suite) is our most minimal approach at building a test suite to help you get started with XLT, get used to the concepts and understand how things are supposed to work. It works on our real-world demo application, the [posters shop](../../quick-start/20-demo-application/), which you can also find on [Github](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) (or in the _samples_ of your official XLT release). It is a good starting point for beginners, but for real-world problems you'll probably want to move on to a more complex sample. Learn more in the [Quickstart section](../../quick-start/30-demo-test-suite/).
