## Introduction

The _<a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-simple-loadtest-suite" target="_blank">posters simple loadtest suite</a>_ is our most minimal approach at building a test suite to help you get started with XLT, get used to the concepts and understand how things are supposed to work. It works on our real-world demo application, the _<a href="../../quick-start/20-demo-application/" target="_blank">posters shop</a>_, which you can also find on <a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store" target="_blank">Github</a> (or in the _samples_ of your official XLT release). It is a good starting point for beginners, but for real-world problems you'll probably want to move on to a more complex sample. Learn more in the [Quickstart section](../../quick-start/30-demo-test-suite/).
