- Helps to find errors
- Great for test documentation

## Result Browser Properties

When running test cases, you can save the page output to disk. The relevant property is `com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk`. By default, it is set to `never` (`always` in development mode). If you want to enable page output to disk, copy the following lines to `dev.properties` or `test.properties` or set the already existing property accordingly:

```bash
## Enables page output to disk. Possible values are:
## - never ..... pages are never logged
## - onError ... pages are logged only if the transaction had errors
## - always .... pages are logged always
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk = always
```

By enabling page output to disk, a lot of data will be aggregated. To minimize this in load test mode, the property may be set to `onError`. Also, the number of actions in record can be set (to keep the latest n actions in record, which is set to 3 by default and to `all` in development mode):

```bash
#com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.size = all
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.size = 3
```

Also, the dump mode (whether modified or only final pages are saved) may be defined: 

```bash
#com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.dumpMode = modifiedAndFinalPages
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.dumpMode = finalPagesOnly
```

So if an error occurs during a transaction in a load test, `output2disk` is set to `onError` and the size is set to `3`, a result browser with the last 3 pages is written to disk. If the error condition is permanent (or present for a longer period of time), we might end up with thousands of (rather similar) result browsers. This tremendously increases the volume of data to be downloaded after the test, but does not provide any new information. Thatâ€™s why you can limit the number of result browsers per type of error and agent.

For each type of error, which is identified by its message and stacktrace, XLT tracks the current number of stored result browsers and stops writing down any new result browser once the configured maximum number is reached. However, you may also configure a time period to periodically clear the counter. Use this setting to limit the maximum number of result browsers for a given time period instead of the whole test runtime.

```bash
# maximum number of different error types per agent  
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.limiter.maxDifferentErrors = 1000

# number of result browsers per agent and type of error  
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.limiter.maxDumps = 10

# period after which the result dump counter is reset to 0  
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.limiter.resetInterval = 1h 30m
```

## Using the Result Browser

All saved results can be found in the `<testsuite>/results` directory. See the lines below for details of the results subdirectory structure:

```txt
---+ results
   `---+ [testcase]
       `---+ [virtual-user]
           `---+ output
               `---+ [transaction-ID]
                   |---- css
                   |---- images
                   |---+ pages
                   |   `--- cache
                   `---- responses
```

In the folders for each test run (`results/[testcase]/[virtual-user]/output/[transaction-ID]`), you find an `index.html` containing the _XLT Result Browser_. The result browser offers an integrated navigation to browse the complete page output of the transaction and to look at every single request in detail. The file `last.html` in the output folder `results/[testcase]/[virtual-user]/output` references the result browser for the last executed transaction of this virtual user.

The result browser navigation will only permit access to the pages of a transaction if they are directly related to actions. Therefore, defining actions correctly is very important to make the most effective use of the result browser. For details on how to structure test cases and create actions, also see [Basic Concepts](../030-concepts) and [Code Structuring Recommendations](../450-test-suites/#). {{< TODO >}}add anchor to test suite code structuring{{< /TODO >}}

If you click on one of the action names in the navigation, the result browser will show the respective page. When you double-click an action name, the navigation will expand to list all related requests. The listed requests are color-coded with black, {{< ctext color="grey" >}}grey{{< /ctext >}}, {{< ctext color="red" >}}red{{< /ctext >}}, {{< ctext color="blue" >}}blue{{< /ctext >}}, {{< ctext color="#7D28C0" >}}lilac{{< /ctext >}} and {{< ctext color="green" >}}green{{< /ctext >}} based on the following algorithm:

* If the request's status code is 301 or 302 then set its color to {{< ctext color="grey" >}}grey{{< /ctext >}} since it is a Redirect.
* If the request's status code is 0 or greater than equal to 400 then set its color to {{< ctext color="red" >}}red{{< /ctext >}} because it is an Error.
* Set the color initially to black and check the content type of the response if it matches the following criteria:
	* It contains the string `javascript` or is equal to `application/json`. If this is the case, change the color to {{< ctext color="#7D28C0" >}}lilac{{< /ctext >}}.
	* It starts with the string `image`. In this case change the color to {{< ctext color="green" >}}green{{< /ctext >}}.
	* It is equal to `text/css`. This content type denotes CSS and thus change the color to {{< ctext color="blue" >}}blue{{< /ctext >}}.

{{% warning notitle %}}
Please note that the content type is determined by the appropriate HTTP response header value. Thus, if an JavaScript file is delivered as content type `text/plain` then this request will be color-coded with black.
{{% /warning %}}

When you select one of the requests from the navigation, the page content will be replaced by detailed information about the request and the related response that you can access via the four tabs on top of the page. The following information is available:

* *Request/Response Information*
	* General Information
	* Request and Response Headers
	* URL Query and POST Parameters (if any)
	* for POST requests: either the form data or (a part of) the raw request body
	* for PUT and PATCH requests: (a part of) the raw request body
* *Request Body (Raw)*
* *Response Content*

## Request timeline
In order to let you inspect the temporal sequence
and duration of requests in a graphical timeline view, XLT may
generate an HTTP Archive (HAR) file along with an appropriate viewer as
part of the result browser. The HAR file contains information about all
requests/responses grouped by their corresponding action, including
headers, sizes, and network timings. For client-performance tests, page
load event timings are included as well. In order to save valuable disk
space, the response content is NOT included in the generated HAR files.

To enable this feature, add the following line to your test
configuration:

```
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.writeHarFile = true
```

The HAR viewer can be opened either by clicking the *View as HAR* link
in the result browser or directly by opening the `harviewer.html` file
in the root directory of the result browser.
