## Platform Independence and Java

## Open Source

## Disclaimer
You might recall the Script Developer. An IDE integrated in Firefox to record, edit, and execute test automation. When Mozilla abandoned the XUL-interface API and effectively broke the add-on concept in half, XLT had to abandon its UI interface for test automation as well. 

If you still need the Script Developer, you can find it in older XLT version (4.13.X and older). XLT can still execute the exported XML test case definition files, but we strongly suggest to go the pure programming route.
