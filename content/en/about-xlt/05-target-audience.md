    More about for which markets and audiences XLT has been written.

XLT has been written by a testing company to have a tool available that provides greater flexibility, better reports, and also enhances trust in the results. The power it delivers might be its biggest downside, because it is not the typical all-purpose easy-peasy load testing tool.

## XLT is for you if...
* you are a Software Engineer or a Software Engineer in Test,
* you love detailed data and the ability to post-process it,
* you need strong validation,
* you want to combine performance and truly understand the application,
* you are looking for a solution you can use in your preferred IDE,
* your tests need to be flexible and predictable,
* the control over data and logic is important.

## XLT might not fit if...
* you need Capture & Replay,
* property files, source code, and version control scare you,
* the command line isn't your cup of tea,
* programming a test suite is a no-go, you rather only configure a test.

## XLT is suitable for... 
* any kind of load and performance test, preferably over HTTP, but XLT also have been used already for WebSocket, FTP, and WebDAV testing,
* tests that require a lot of machines and locations,
* you very own CI/CD setup,
* extensive data processing of results, because it does not hide anything and permits you to add data sources as well as capture more data at any time,
* frameworks and setups that are not just plain url tests, but require custom data, custom processing, flexible logic based flows and much more...

This manual will mention and demo some of these not really straight forward load and performance test setups alongside the business as usual tests.
