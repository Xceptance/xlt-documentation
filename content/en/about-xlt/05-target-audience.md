## Introduction

XLT has been written by a testing company to have a tool available that provides greater flexibility, better reports, and also enhances trust in the results. The power it delivers might be its biggest downside, because it is not the typical all-purpose easy-peasy load testing tool.

### XLT is for you if...
* you are a Software Engineer or a Software Engineer in Test,
* you love detailed data and the ability to post-process it,
* you need strong validation,
* you want to combine performance with truly understanding the application,
* you are looking for a solution you can use in your preferred IDE,
* your tests need to be flexible but predictable.

### XLT might not fit if...
* you need Capture & Replay,
* property files, source code, and version control scare you,
* the command line isn't your cup of tea.
