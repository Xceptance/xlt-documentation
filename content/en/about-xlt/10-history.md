## Why Have We Built Another Tool?

Needed a platform independent tool
Other tools with bad license schemes
Tools mostly request level testing
Cumbersome UIs
No easy scaling
Limited reporting capabilities
Wrong OS
Proprietary languages
Data difficult to postprocess
Simple deployment requirements
Extensibility
No easy sharing with the customer
Needed more trust in the results!

## 2005 - Early Prototype

## 2007 - First Product Offer

## 2010 - Test Automation 

## 2016 - v4.8

## 2017 - Script Developer Discontinued

## 2018 - XLT at no Charge
Over the years we have seen many people working with other performance test tools and found that often they chose one primarily because of the price or simply because it was already a familiar tool in the company. This is not necessarily bad but it is certainly not always optimal. 

People run into seat limits, operating system limitations, debugging limits, extensibility limits, have to use poor reporting, or cannot adjust features or functionalities. We wanted to give the testing world a tool that will be chosen because it fits and not because the license is cheaper or has already been purchased. That's why, starting in January 2018, XLT has been free of charge for load and performance testing.

## 2018 - More CI/CD Support

## 2019 - v4.13

## 2020 - XLT goes Open Source
In February 2020 XLT went completely open source, being published on Github under [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0). A license file is no longer needed.

Xceptance will continue to maintain and extend XLT as before. Releases will be built and published by Xceptance on a regular schedule. Libraries will be published to Maven Central as part of the open-sourcing process. The latest releases will be available from the XLT GitHub repository as well.

We still keep the [legacy documentation](https://lab.xceptance.de/releases/xlt/latest/index.html) around, just in case you need information about older or deprecated XLT versions or functionalities. For everything else, this is the new documentation, also published on Github and still growing.

If you are interested in training, projects, or support for XLT and load testing in general, we of course also offer those services, and will expand this offering further in upcoming months.

By open sourcing, we are opening a new chapter for XLT and we invite everyone to join us. More to come!
