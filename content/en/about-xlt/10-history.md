## Why Have We Built Another Tool?

Needed a platform independent tool
Other tools with bad license schemes
Tools mostly request level testing
Cumbersome UIs
No easy scaling
Limited reporting capabilities
Wrong OS
Proprietary languages
Data difficult to postprocess
Simple deployment requirements
Extensibility
No easy sharing with the customer
Needed more trust in the results!

## 2005 - Early Prototype

## 2007 - First Product Offer

## 2010 - Test Automation 

## 2016 - v4.8

## 2017 - Script Developer Discontinued
With the release of Firefox 57, Mozilla decided to completely remove the support for legacy extensions for security reasons. In consequence, XLT Script Developer could no longer be installed and used in Firefox. 

We at Xceptance had been aware of this development, but after a user survey and an evaluation of several alternative options, we came to the conclusion that the feature set and comfort that had been offered by XLT Script Developer and its way of writing web automation cannot be recreated using the alternative Firefox APIs. Therefore, XLT Script Developer was discontinued. Read more in this [blog post](https://blog.xceptance.com/2017/10/27/firefox-57-changes-and-xlt/). 

## 2018 - XLT at no Charge

## 2018 - More CI/CD Support

## 2019 - v4.13
