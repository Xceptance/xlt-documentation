## Architecture

All about mastercontroller, agents, suites, and monitoring if relevant.

* Test Suite Code and configuration
* Mastercontroller (MC)
* Agents -The test executors
* Deployments
* Grafana for realtime test information
 
* MC is loosely coupled
* Use another one to interact or continue


* No reason to stay connected
* Reattach later to MC and continue work
* Hand over to colleagues
* Get intermediate results anytime
* Run multiple test from one machine
* Have the test machine somewhere else (Remote MC)
* No database, results and reports easily archiveable
* Create reports any time from results
* Results/reports preserve test setups, repeat test easily
