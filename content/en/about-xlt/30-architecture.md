## Architecture

All about mastercontroller, agents, suites, and monitoring if relevant.

Test Suite Code and configuration
MC Mastercontroller
Agents The test executors
Grafana Realtime test information
 
MC is loosely coupled
Use another one to interact or continue



No reason to stay connected
Reattach later to MC and continue work
Hand over to colleagues
Get intermediate results anytime
Run multiple test from one machine
Have the test machine somewhere else (Remote MC)
No database, results and reports easily archiveable
Create reports any time from results
Results/reports preserve test setups, repeat test easily
