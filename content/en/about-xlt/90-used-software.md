    The open source software and components used to build this documentation.

---

Our goal in building a new and comprehensive documentation for XLT was to use open source components for this as well. Below you find a list of frameworks, fonts and their respective licenses which we put to work to create the documentation you are now reading.

## Framework

### Hugo

The documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which boasts being "one of the most popular open-source static site generators" and, like XLT, is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). 

### Theme: Docsy

Hugo can be run using a number of predefined themes as well as your own themes - we are using the [Docsy](https://docsy.dev/) theme as a base and add our CI flavor to this. Docsy is a theme specifically designed "for technical documentation sets" and also comes with an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Fonts

### Roboto and Ubuntu Mono

The fonts that are used in the documentation are Roboto and Ubuntu Mono, originally both part of the [Google fonts project](https://github.com/google/fonts) but hosted on our own servers. Roboto is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) while Ubuntu Mono comes with the [Ubuntu font license](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ufl/ubuntumono/LICENCE.txt).

## JavaScript

### Search: Algolia DocSearch

The documentation search is using [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) which is free for all technical documentation websites of open source projects and is itself licensed under an [MIT license](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/next/LICENSE). You can learn more about their **privacy policy** [here](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy/).

### Image Viewer: Lightbox

To display images nicely, we are using [Lightbox](https://victordiego.com/lightbox/) by Victor Diego, which is licensed under the [MIT license](https://victordieggo.mit-license.org/).

### Other Javascript Libraries

Other Javascript libraries used by this documentation (hosted on our own servers) are: 
* Bootstrap ([MIT license](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE)),
* jQuery ([MIT license](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)),
* Popper ([MIT license](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui)).
