    6. Confidentiality
    Each party will maintain in confidence all Confidential Information (as defined

    "Recipient") agrees that it will not use, disclose or grant use of such
    Confidential Information except as expressly authorized by the disclosing party
    ("Discloser") hereunder. Recipient hereby agrees to use at least the same
    standard of care as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a
    similar nature, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to ensure that
    its employees, agents or consultants do not disclose or make any unauthorized
    use of such Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" means any
    confidential or proprietary information, source code, plans or any other
    information relating to any research project, work in process, future
    development, scientific, engineering, manufacturing, marketing or business plan
    or financial or personnel matter relating to Discloser, its present or future
    products, sales, suppliers, Licensees, employees, investors or business,
    identified by Discloser as Confidential Information, whether in oral, written,
    graphic or electronic form. If disclosed in written, graphic or electronic
    form, the information must be marked as confidential. If disclosed in oral
    form, such Confidential Information must be reduced to writing and marked as
    Confidential Information within 30 days following disclosure. The parties agree
    that (i) the material commercial terms of these Terms and (ii) the Software,
    except for in uses expressly permitted hereunder, will also be considered
    Confidential Information of XCEPTANCE.

    The obligations of confidentiality contained in this section will not apply to
    the extent that it can be established by Recipient by competent, documented
    proof that such Confidential Information: (a) was already known to Recipient,
    other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure by
    the Discloser; (b) was generally available to the public or otherwise part of
    the public domain at the time of its disclosure to Recipient; (c) became
    generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after
    its disclosure and other than through any act or omission of Recipient in
    breach of these Terms; (d) was disclosed to Recipient, other than under an
    obligation of confidentiality, by a third party who had no obligation not to
    disclose such information to others; or (e) was developed independently by
    Recipient without reference to or use of the Confidential Information of
    Discloser.

    Each party will promptly return all Confidential Information to the other party
    or destroy upon written request from the Discloser.

    7. Limited Warranties
    XCEPTANCE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY STATUTE OF OTHERWISE,
    REGARDING THE SOFTWARE, OBJECTS OR SERVICES AND XCEPTANCE SPECIFICALLY
    DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
    OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND MERCHANTABILITY.

    or gross negligence. XCEPTANCE shall neither be liable for indirect damage, nor
    consequential harm caused by a defect, nor a loss of profits.

    9. Marketing
    XCEPTANCE and Licensee agree that XCEPTANCE may issue a press release within 60
    days upon the provision of the Software to the Licensee. Upon Licensee's
    request, Licensee will have prior approval of press release, but agrees not to
    unreasonably withhold or delay that approval. Licensee agrees to be a reference
    for XCEPTANCE to potential XCEPTANCE Licensees upon XCEPTANCE's reasonable
    request. XCEPTANCE and Licensee agree that they may engage in mutually
    beneficial marketing activities. XCEPTANCE is permitted to use the name and the
    trademarks of the Licensee when XCEPTANCE is citing the Licensee as a reference
    in conjunction with any marketing activities.

    10. General
    The relationship of XCEPTANCE and Licensee governed by these Terms is
    that of independent contractors. These Terms will be governed by and construed
    exclusively under the laws of Germany. The place of jurisdiction will be
    the location of the party that has been sued. Any notice required or permitted
    to be given under these Terms will be delivered by registered or certified mail
    or overnight courier, postage prepaid, to the address of the other party set
    forth on the cover page hereto. Except for payment obligations, nonperformance
    of either party will be excused to the extent that performance is rendered
    impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable
    control of the non-performing party.

    Licensee agrees that its rights and obligations under these Terms may not be
    transferred or assigned directly or indirectly without the prior written
    consent of XCEPTANCE except that it has already been permitted by these Terms
    or the transfer is part of a merger with another company or the acquisition of
    the Licensee by a third party. In case of a permitted transfer of rights, the
    Licensee ensures that the third party will agree to these terms and conditions.

    Only these Terms shall apply. Terms and conditions of the party receiving the
    Software are not valid, even if not explicitly stated by XCEPTANCE. Additions
    or modifications to these Terms must be made in writing and enter into effect
    only when signed by both parties.

    Should one or more provisions of these Terms be or become invalid, then this
    shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The invalid clause
    shall then be replaced by the parties by a valid clause that comes as close as
    possible, in its economic purpose, to the original intent of the invalid
    clause.
