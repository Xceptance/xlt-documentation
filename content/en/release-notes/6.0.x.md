## XLT 6.0.0



### Overview

Version 6 is a new major release of XLT. It comes with a bunch of new features, but also with a couple of breaking changes. See <a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT/milestone/15?closed=1" target="_blank">here</a> for the complete list of improvements and fixes.

Before we jump to the details, we want to say many thanks to OTTO for supporting us when making this release.

#### Java 11 

JDK 8 is dated. 
Beginning with this release, XLT **requires Java 11** to run. This means you will need a JDK 11 (or later) on your development and load test machines.

#### Selenium 4 
After a while, the Selenium team has released a new version, Selenium 4.x. See their [blog](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2021/announcing-selenium-4/) to learn what is new in Selenium 4. **XLT now bundles Selenium 4**.

Although Selenium 4 is intended to be a drop-in replacement for most users, there might be things that need to be migrated. See the [migration guide](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/upgrade_to_selenium_4/) in the official Selenium documentation.

In this course, some constructors of `XltChromeDriver` and `XltFirefoxDriver` that had been marked as deprecated for a while, were eventually removed.

#### Logging Framework Update
The previously used logging framework log4j 1.x has been replaced with **latest log4j 2.x**. log4j2 brings not only performance improvements, but is also not vulnerable to any known security issues.

During this upgrade XLT has been made completely agnostic to the underlying logging framework and XLT will now log through the logging facade SLF4J only. This also means that some features that had made direct use of the log4j API are not available any longer. See the following list of incompatible changes:

* The type of `XltLogger.runtimeLogger` has changed to `org.slf4j.Logger`.
* The `timers.csv` files, the data files where XLT stores its measurements to, do no longer roll-over to a new file at midnight. So there is always only a single `timers.csv` file for each test user.
* When running test cases directly from your IDE, the logging framework is no longer auto-configured from file `<testsuite>/config/dev-log4j.properties`, but from a new file in the class path. See the migration guide below for details.
* The log4j2 configuration files require a slightly different property syntax.
* The Javascript debugger that logs the Javascript statements as they are being executed is not available at the moment. 

#### Other Changes

The **documentation is no longer shipped** as part of the XLT distribution archive. 

Credentials may be passed as part of the _user info_ in URLs, such as in `https://user:pass@host/`. In order to not reveal this sensitive information by mistake, XLT now makes substantial effort to **remove credentials from any URL** it records. This includes the data in the `timers.csv` files and also the result browser. This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled as follows:

```
com.xceptance.xlt.results.data.request.removeUserInfoFromURL = true
```
 
### Migration Guide

As outlined above, XLT 6.x comes with changes that may break your existing test suites. In order to migrate your test suites to XLT 6, you will need to perform the following steps:

* Ensure a JDK 11 is installed.
* Reconfigure the project files of your IDE to use Java 11 to compile and run your test cases.
* If your test suite comes with an Ant/Gradle/Maven build files, adjust these to use Java 11 as well.
* Update the logging framework configuration files: 
    * Copy `<xlt>/samples/testsuite-template/config/log4j2.properties` to your test suite and adjust it to your needs. This file replaces the old `log4j.properties` and will be used when executing your test scenarios in a load test.
    * Also copy `<xlt>/samples/testsuite-template/src/log4j2-test.properties` into the class path of your test suite and adapt it as needed. This file replaces the old `dev-log4j.properties` and will be used when executing your test scenarios from your IDE during development and test.
    * Delete the old log4j 1.x configuration files `config/log4j.properties` and `config/dev-log4j.properties`. They are not used any longer.
* Now fix any compiler errors:
    * If there are still references to log4j 1.x in your code, replace them by SLF4J.
    * If your code uses Selenium classes that do not exists any longer in Selenium 4.x, rework your code for Selenium 4.x.
    * If you made direct use of `XltChromeDriver` or `XltFirefoxDriver`, make sure you use any of the current constructors/builder methods.
* Completely rebuild your test suite. 


### AWS AMI Retirement Notice

Xceptance provides machines images for Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud with XLT installed and preconfigured for use as load agents.

As part of our regular clean-up process, we will **retire AWS AMIs older than XLT version 5.6.x on March, 1st 2022**. If you need an older version, please build your own AMI (see https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT-Packer) or copy the respective AMI to your own AMI registry in time.

As a notice for the future: Xceptance will not guarantee that provided AMIs (and, in the future, Docker images or images for other cloud providers) are available forever. We strongly encourage you to migrate to the most recent version. If you need a particular setup maintained for a longer period of time, please talk to Xceptance and consider a support contract.
