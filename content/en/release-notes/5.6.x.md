## XLT 5.5.0

See <a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT/milestone/13?closed=1" target="_blank">here</a> for the complete list of improvements and fixes.

### Test Framework

#### Secret properties for load tests

Properties can now be marked as "secret" by either prefixing their name with `secret.` or putting them in the file
`secret.properties` in the load test configuration directory. Secret properties are available under their prefixed
name (i.e. `secret.property`), as well as their bare form (`property`). The values of secret properties are masked
in the test result set and configuration reports.
