## Test Framework

### Result Browser

**Request timeline** - In order to let you inspect the temporal sequence
and duration of requests in a graphical timeline view, XLT may now
generate an HTTP Archive (HAR) file along with an appropriate viewer as
part of the result browser. The HAR file contains information about all
requests/responses grouped by their corresponding action, including
headers, sizes, and network timings. For client-performance tests, page
load event timings are included as well. In order to save valuable disk
space, the response content is NOT included in the generated HAR files.

To enable this feature, add the following line to your test
configuration:

```
com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.writeHarFile = true
```

The HAR viewer can be opened either by clicking the *View as HAR* link
in the result browser or directly by opening the `harviewer.html` file
in the root directory of the result browser.

**Request body for PUT and PATCH** - On the *Request/Response
Information* tab, the XLT Result Browser shows almost all information
about a certain request at a glance. For POST requests, either the form
data or (a part of) the raw request body is shown as well. Now the raw
request body of PUT and PATCH requests is also shown this way.
Especially if the request body is small, you will often get the
information you need without having to switch to the *Request Body* tab
and back again.

### Other Improvements

**ExclusiveDataProvider to filter out comment lines** - The
`ExclusiveDataProvider` can now be configured to filter out comment
lines from its test data file, i.e. lines that start with `#`.
Previously, this was the responsibility of the data item parser. If the
`ExclusiveDataProvider` handles comment lines the benefits are twofold:

-   The logic of the data item parser can be simpler.
-   The resulting exclusive data partitions, one for each agent, are
    sized more equally as comment lines are filtered out *before*
    partitioning the data.

If you want the `ExclusiveDataProvider` to filter out comment lines,
create it as follows:

```java
edp = ExclusiveDataProvider.getInstance(“coupons.txt”, true);
```

**Maximize browser window** - XLT can manage the life cycle of web
drivers and web browsers on your behalf, but you may configure many
aspects in the settings of your test suite, for instance the dimension
of the browser window. As an alternative to a fixed browser window size,
you may now configure XLT to maximize the browser window instead:

```
xlt.webDriver.window.maximize = true
```

Please note that this setting overrides any window size settings if
present as well.

**HtmlUnit updated** - HtmlUnit and its accompanying HtmlUnitDriver have
been updated to version 2.35.

#### Incompatible Changes

**PhantomJSDriver removed** - As the PhantomJS project reached its end
of life and the latest available version of PhantomJSDriver stopped
working using the latest version of Selenium/WebDriver, the support for
PhantomJS has been dropped from XLT.
