## XLT 3.2.2

A complete list of changes can be found at [XLT Information Center -
Release 3.2.2](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/21). Please note that
only customers and partners with a valid login can access the
Information Center. If you are a customer or partner and you have not
gotten access yet, feel free to send an email to Xceptance Support.

### Improvements

This section lists all improvements to existing features including a
short documentation of how you can benefit from it.

#### Master controller reports total time and progress (\#445)

The master controller reports the total test runtime and the progress
independent of the current iteration progress now. Previously, only an
iteration update triggered a progress update.

#### Script recorder support for Firefox 3.5 (\#479)

The script recorder supports all Mozilla Firefox versions up to 3.5 now.

#### HTTP header information in result HTML files (\#446)

XLT saves - when configured - all received responses to disk for further
evaluation. For HTML responses, XLT added request/response header
information as HTML comment to the top of the file. Sometimes this is
inconvenient, especially when referencing line information from error
messages. Therefore all header information is now written to the end of
the file to keep the line number references intact.

### Bug Fixes

This sections covers all the important defects that were fixed with this
release.

#### Result Browser did not render results correctly when served via web (\#356)

The data from the result browser could not be served via a web server,
because the content types of the data objects were unknown. This has
been fixed.

#### Exception when saving pages to disk (\#507)

Several problems have been fixed, when pages could not be saved to disk
for later display with the result browser.

#### Static resources are not loaded using parallel threads (\#470)

XLT loads static resources, such as images or CSS files, asynchronously
using parallel threads. However, sometimes just one thread is busy
loading resources while the others do nothing. This has been fixed now.
XLT is using all configured threads now to load static content
concurrently.

#### Number of parallel connection per host was limited (\#503)

The number of parallel connections for downloading static content was
limited to two, even though the thread count was set higher. Reason was
the internal connection handling of the HTTP client per host. This
limitation has been removed.

#### Report generator failed to load reports from archives (\#458)

The report generator is able to load report data from archives. The
archive path was not detected correctly and the archive could not be
opened. This has been fixed now. Archives, such as ZIP, JAR, TAR,
compressed TAR can be used to read report data from.

#### Undefined actions were recorded (\#490)

Under rare circumstances, the recorder created undefined actions. This
has been fixed.

#### XLT was caching too aggressively (\#483)

When the server did not send any caching hints as part of the response
headers, XLT assumed that the response is cache-able forever. However,
browsers do not cache the response in this case. The standard says:

{{% note notitle %}}
If none of Expires, Cache-Control: max-age, or Cache-Control: s-maxage
(see section 14.9.3) appears in the response, and the response does
not include other restrictions on caching, the cache MAY compute a
freshness lifetime using a heuristic. The cache MUST attach Warning
113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning
has not already been added.
{{% /note %}}

If no caching hint was sent by the server, the cache does no longer
assume that the response is cache-able forever. Instead, if a
Last-Modified response header is present, the cache uses some heuristics
to derive an appropriate expiration time from it (10% of the resource’s
current age). Otherwise, the response is not cached at all.

## XLT 3.2.1

A complete list of changes can be found at [XLT Information Center -
Release 3.2.1](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/20). Please note that
only customers and partners with a valid login can access the
Information Center. If you are a customer or partner and you have not
gotten access yet, feel free to send an email to Xceptance Support.

### Improvements

This section lists all improvements to existing features including a
short documentation of how you can benefit from it.

#### Enhanced merge rules for request reporting (\#435)

To allow more flexibility in the automated processing of requests,
especially when sorting implicit background calls which have not been
named correctly, the request merge rules have been enhanced. Now they
permit you to specify multiple capturing groups, which can then be used
to compose the name based on the captured data. Additionally the
processing can be continued after a rule matches. The data can be passed
through several rules and more than one rule can be applied. This can be
useful when requests have to be *renamed* first and afterwards
*regrouped*.

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.newName = {n:1} CSS  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.namePattern = ([^.]+)  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.contentTypePattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.statusCodePattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.urlPattern = \\.css$  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.stopOnMatch = true
```

This example shows that the `newName` parameter can contain
placeholders. The placeholder content is fed by the capturing groups
within `namePattern`, `contentTypePattern`, `statusCodePattern`, and
`urlPattern`. The raw syntax is: `{<patternId>:<capturingGroupIndex>}`,
where patternId is one of the following letters:

- “n” (for namePattern),
- “c” (for contentTypePattern),  
- “s” (for statusCodePattern), and  
- “u” (for urlPattern)

The capturingGroupIndex indicates which capturing group from your
expression is used. 0 stands for the entire matching string, even
without any group specified. All other numbers indicate the group to
use. If a group is not available or the syntax of the string is wrong,
no error message is thrown.

The new parameter `stopOnMatch` allows chaining of rules. By default,
the processing of the rules will stop as soon as a rule matches
(`stopOnMatch = true`). In case you want to apply several rules one
after the other, just specify `stopOnMatch = false` for the rule. Keep
in mind that the first matching rule with a true will stop the request
merging.

{{% warning notitle %}}
The improvement breaks the existing merge rules, because before they
implicitly included the capture group from the name in the composition
of the new name. Please adjust your rules accordingly. Most of the
time it is only necessary to explicitly include the `namePattern`
capture output in the `newName` definition, such as
`newName = {n:0} Images`.
{{% /warning %}}

##### Example for Groups

For instance, if the pattern `urlPattern = (http[s]{0,1})://([^/]+)/.*`
is specified and the URL is `http://www.mytest.net/`, the placeholder
`{n:0}` will return `http://www.mytest.net/`, `{n:1}` will return
`http`, and `{n:2}` will return `www.mytest.net`.

##### Example for Chaining

This example shows how you can use the chaining of rules to apply
several merging rules. The first rule splits the requests by protocol to
build up individual buckets. The second rule marks requests when a
redirect response code was issued, such as 301 and 302.

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.newName = {n:1} - {u:1}  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.namePattern = ([^.]+)  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.contentTypePattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.statusCodePattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.urlPattern = ^(http[s]*)://  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.0.stopOnMatch = false

com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.newName = {n:1} - {s:1}  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.namePattern = ([^.]+)  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.contentTypePattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.statusCodePattern = (30[12])  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.urlPattern =  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.1.stopOnMatch = false
```

Just some URLs with their initial name and response code:

```bash
Homepage http://www.mytest.org/ [301]
Homepage.1 http://www.mytest.org/landing - [200]  
Catalog http://www.mytest.org/catalog1.html - [200]  
Catalog http://www.mytest.org/catalog2.html - [200]  
MyAccount http://www.mytest.org/account - [200]  
MyAccount https://www.mytest.org/registerme - [200]
```

After the processing, the resulting set of request names will look like
this. The URL listed in parentheses after the name is not part of the
name; it just illustrates where the URLs ended up.

```bash
Homepage - http (http://www.mytest.org/landing)  
Homepage - http - 301 (http://www.mytest.org/)  
Catalog - http (http://www.mytest.org/catalog1.html,
http://www.mytest.org/catalog2.html)  
MyAccount - http (http://www.mytest.org/account)  
MyAccount - https (https://www.mytest.org/account)
```

### Bug Fixes

This sections covers all the important defects that were fixed with this
release.

#### Incorrect loading of static content (\#425)

Some static resources were not loaded when included via the style
attribute in the HTML code. Now these resources will be picked up and
loaded correctly.

#### Incorrect loading of content form link tags (\#423)

Some resources referenced via \<link\> tags were being loaded, even though
they were marked as alternate content. This content is now excluded from
static content loading.

```html
<link rel="alternate" media="handheld" href="http://www.abcdefg24.com/">
```

#### Problems with curly braces in properties (\#436)

The handling of curly braces in properties was too strict and has now
been relaxed. Curly braces permit the replacement of data in properties
with another property.

##### Example

```bash
com.test.host = www.test.org
com.test.url = http://${com.test.host}/
```

#### Agent process did not stop (\#422)

Under some circumstances, an agent process did not stop, because a
thread was hanging in a sleep() operation. This is probably OS or JDK
related, but a workaround has been implemented to reduce the likelihood
of its happening.

## XLT 3.2.0

A complete list of changes can be found at [XLT Information Center -
Release 3.2.0](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/1). Please note that
only customers and partners with a valid login can access the
Information Center. If you are a customer or partner and you have not
gotten access yet, feel free to send an email to Xceptance Support.

### Features

This section documents all new features and additions to Xceptance
LoadTest.

#### Script Recorder

The XLT Script Recorder Firefox extension has been significantly
reworked. There are many new enhancements and fixes. The major
highlights are:

-   Improved user interface.
-   Enhanced recording capabilities for web sites that use JavaScript
    extensively.
-   The generated Java classes are shorter and more comprehensible.
-   The script recorder updates automatically if a new version is
    published on the XLT web site.

Note that, for older versions of the recorder that are already installed
in Firefox, the automatic update mechanism is not available. Simply
install the new `.xpi` file manually in this case. You will find this
file in `<xlt>/tools`. Furthermore, only patch releases (e.g. v3.2.1)
will be installed automatically. To upgrade to a new major version (e.g.
v3.3.0) in the future, you will still have to install the extension
manually.

#### Loading of Static Resources from CSS (\#61)

XLT will now load static resources from referenced CSS files when the
property `com.xceptance.xlt.loadStaticContent` is set to `true`. This
makes the performance characteristics of XLT more comparable to real
browsers.

All static resources from CSS files will be loaded even if the resource
is not used on the current page.

#### Configurable User-Agent (\#60)

The user agent name that is sent to the server with every request can
now be configured. Please use the new property
`com.xceptance.xlt.browser.userAgent`. The agent name will not be
altered in any way. This means that you will not be able to distinguish
XLT requests from normal browser requests on the server side.

Setting this property does not change the internal browser handling that
can be configured using the known property `com.xceptance.xlt.browser`.
Only the transferred agent name will change.

A list of typical agent names can be obtained from
[User-Agents.org](http://www.user-agents.org/).

```bash
## The user agent string that will be sent to the server. By default, the user
## agent string is derived from the configured browser, but can be overridden
## with this setting.  
#com.xceptance.xlt.browser.userAgent =
```

##### Example

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.browser.userAgent = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;\
	Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10  
com.xceptance.xlt.browser.userAgent = Test User-Agent sent by Xceptance LoadTest
```

### Improvements

This section lists all improvements to existing features including a
short documentation of how you can benefit from them.

#### Bypass Proxy Rules (\#111)

You can now specify a rule to bypass your proxy settings for certain
machines by setting `com.xceptance.xlt.proxy.bypassForHosts`. This
property supports regular expressions.

##### Example

The following example will exclude the hosts `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
and all hosts starting with 192.168.

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.proxy.bypassForHosts = localhost 127\\.0\\.0\\.1 ^192\\.168
```

{{% note notitle %}}
The example escapes the dot for the regular expression engine so as to
use it as a normal character and not as a regexp command. Due to the
Java property syntax a `\` has to be escaped with another `\` to be
passed and recognized.
{{% /note %}}

#### Support for development mode specific properties (\#88)

Now XLT tries to load an additional property file during development
mode (meaning when it is not in load test mode): `dev.properties`.

##### Load Test Mode

During a load test, the properties files in `testsuite/config` are read
in this order:

1.  `default.properties`
2.  `project.properties`
3.  test-specific property file, e.g. `test.properties`

If the same property is specified in multiple files, the last settings
from the last file read will be used.

##### Development Mode

During development, these files are loaded and the properties are set up
accordingly:

1.  `default.properties`
2.  `project.properties`
3.  test specific property file, e.g. `test.properties`
4.  `dev.properties`

It is not possible to unset a property in a later property file. Its
value can only be set to empty.

#### Full debug mode for page during development (\#114)

In development mode, i.e. when developing/running/testing test cases,
the received responses and the parsed pages will always be written to
disk, regardless of what the current dump mode configuration is. Having
the data on disk is usually a big help during development. This helps to
manage the configuration for load testing and development, because it is
no longer possible to accidently keep the dump mode enabled while
running a load test (assuming it is set to onError by default).

#### Library updates

The underlying libraries of HtmlUnit, JUnit, Log4J, NekoHtml have been
updated with the latest or newer versions.

{{% warning notitle %}}
Please do not update the libraries yourself, because certain
dependencies have to be maintained, and some defects have been fixed
which may or may not be part of the next official library release.
{{% /warning %}}

#### Garbage collection reporting for Agents (\#122)

Now additional GC statistics are shown in the agent part of the test
report. This includes GC activity numbers, separated in full and minor
GC phase. Furthermore, the CPU chart shows the CPU usage of the GC next
to the total CPU usage.

Note that, when the CMS GC is used (`-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`), no
values are available for the full GC phase on some OS. This is a known
[JVM
defect](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6580448).

{{< /image >}}

#### Redesign of the Test Report (\#124)

The test report has been completely redesigned. A new navigation section
saves valuable screen space and a new color scheme improves the visual
impression and presentation. Additionally the entire report is
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) based. This allows easier adaptations to
project needs and allows the use of other jQuery plug-ins.

{{< image src="releasenotes/new-test-report-design-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/new-test-report-design-large.jpg" >}}

{{< /image >}}

{{% note notitle %}}
jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML
document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions
for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that
you write JavaScript.
{{% /note %}}

#### New Result Browser (\#123)

The concept of the result browser has been completely reworked. The new
result browser displays the entire session (or the last actions when
used for capturing load test errors) with such important details as
request and response parameters, loaded resources, executed
sub-requests, and the final rendered image of the web page.

{{< image src="releasenotes/new-result-browser-overview-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/new-result-browser-overview-large.jpg" >}}
The new result browser interface
{{< /image >}}

The web site in the result browser might not match the real web site
when actively browsing it. Reasons for this are the suppressed execution
of some JavaScript, as well as missing cookies.

#### Do not mark requests with a response code of 4xx as failed (\#396)

Older versions of XLT marked a request as failed when the HTTP status
code was \>= 400. It then also appeared as failed in the test report.
Additionally the framework might have thrown a
`FailingHttpStatusCodeException` (if configured using
`com.xceptance.xlt.stopTestOnHttpErrors.page`, with true as default).
This effectively aborted the test.

Because it is not illegal to serve valid content with a status code
other than 200, and the post validation can resolve whether or not it is
an error, XLT’s behavior was changed. It now no longer throws a
`FailingHttpStatusCodeException` and it will not be marked as failed.

All status codes starting with 500 are still considered an error and
will throw an exception and be logged in the final test report.

#### Event count in reports and console (\#355)

XLT now displays the event count for a transaction in the report and on
the console. This allows for quick feedback and simplifies the
evaluation of running load tests.

{{< image src="releasenotes/events-on-console-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/events-on-console-large.png" >}}
Events on the console output
{{< /image >}}

#### Performance Improvements (\#352)

Several areas of XLT have been optimized to utilize the available
hardware much better. Contention points in several components have been
reduced or removed.

#### Concurrent User Chart for Transactions (\#331)

For each transaction, a new chart is displayed in the reports showing
the number of concurrent users over the testing period. This helps in
better understanding the changing load situations and improves error
diagnostics.

{{< image src="releasenotes/new-concurrent-user-chart-in-transaction-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/new-concurrent-user-chart-in-transaction-large.png" >}}
The new concurrent user chart
{{< /image >}}

#### Improved Time Formats (\#130)

XLT now supports more intuitive time settings for the load profile and
will also display the time in reports in a more readable format.

##### Display in Reports

{{< image src="releasenotes/new-time-format-settings-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/new-time-format-settings-large.png" >}}
Time formatting in reports
{{< /image >}}

##### Usage in Load Definition

All time period values can be specified in one of the following formats
(single quotes are not part of the definition):

-   Total number of seconds, such as ‘1234s’ or ‘1234’.
-   Natural style, such as ‘0h 12m 00s’, ‘0h 12m’, ‘12m 0s’ or ‘12m’
-   Digit style, such as ‘1:23’, ‘01:23’, ‘0:1:23’ or ‘0:01:23’

#### Reworked Load Test Configuration (\#131)

Configuring the load profile is much easier now. Instead of defining an
over-all duration and then splitting it up into several periods, we now
simply define these periods, which in turn will add up to the final
duration. This avoids those little calculation errors that may happen so
easily and will save you from having to repeat a wrongly configured load
test.

##### Definitions

-   users - the (maximum) number of threads that run the test in
    parallel (**required**)
-   iterations - the number of iterations per thread
-   arrivalRate - the number of transactions per hour
-   initialDelay - the number of seconds to wait at the beginning
-   warmUpPeriod - the number of seconds to run without performing
    measurements
-   measurementPeriod - the number of seconds to perform measurements
    (**required**)
-   shutdownPeriod - the number of seconds to continue without
    performing measurements
-   rampUpPeriod - the number of seconds to steadily increase the user
    count
-   rampUpStepSize - the number of users to step-wise increase the load
    during ramp-up

The *arrivalRate* value influences the way the load is generated. If
omitted, the system generates a constant load based on the number of
concurrent users. If specified, the system generates load with a
cluster-wide constant arrival rate. In the latter case, the maximum load
is limited by the number of concurrent users. Note that an arrival rate
is only supported for non-iteration based load tests.

The following figure shows the relationship between the various
settings:


	   : initialDelay :   warmUpPeriod   : measurementPeriod : shutdownPeriod :
	   :              :                  :                   :                :
	   ^              :                  :                   :                :
	 L |              :                  :                   :                :
	 o |              :                  :                   :                :
	 a |              :                ****************************************
	 d |              :            ****:
	   |              :        ****    :
	   |              :    ****        :
	   |              :****            :
	   +--------------*----------------------------------------------------------->
	   :              :                :                                      Time
	   : initialDelay :  rampUpPeriod  :


The *warmUpPeriod* is the time we will give the load to level out before
taking measurements, and starts directly after the *initialDelay*. This
is done to minimize discrepancies that could be caused by applications
and other systems starting up and not yet operating at an optimal level.
Once this time has elapsed, the stable load will be measured during the
*measurementPeriod*. To ensure a constant load until the very end of the
measurement period, a *shutdownPeriod* can be set in which the users
will continue to run before stopping abruptly. The *rampUpPeriod*
setting is independent of the *warmUpPeriod*, *measurementPeriod*, and
*shutdownPeriod* settings and dictates the time that it will take for
the load to increase to 100% after the initial delay.

##### Example 1

Imagine a load test with two test cases: TAuthor and TVisitor. First we
will define when measurements will take place and when not. We don’t
want to measure before the system has reached a steady state, so we
define a warm-up period of 20 minutes. After this time, we perform
measurements for one hour. After the measurement period we want the test
to continue for another 5 minutes, so we define the shutdown period
appropriately.

Second, we will define the way the load is generated. For TVisitor, we
define a constant load generated by 10 users. The TAuthor scenario,
however, should be executed 200 times per hour. To exactly generate this
load, XLT can use up to 20 users. We will set the settings for TAuthor
appropriately. Since we do not want to start with the maximum load, we
let the load increase steadily by defining a ramp-up period. Note that
the ramp-up period is 15 minutes - slightly smaller than the warm-up
period - to give the system another 5 minutes to level out before
measurements begin.

The necessary configuration is shown here:

```bash
## Default configuration.  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.default.initialDelay = 0  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.default.warmUpPeriod = 20m  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.default.measurementPeriod = 60m  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.default.shutdownPeriod = 5m  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.default.rampUpPeriod = 15m

## Test case specific configuration.  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.TVisitor.users = 10  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.TAuthor.users = 20  
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.TAuthor.arrivalRate = 200
```

Now have a look at the timeline:


       :   warmUpPeriod   : measurementPeriod : sh :
       :                  :                   :    :
       ^                  :                   :    :
     L |                  :                   :    :
     o |                  :                   :    :
     a |                ****************************
     d |            ****:
       |        ****    :
       |    ****        :
       |****            :
       *----------------------------------------------------------->
       :                :                                      Time
       :  rampUpPeriod  :


##### Example 2

This time we want to load test the TAuthor scenario only. Again, we
define the measurement time first, 30 minutes this time. As we are
especially interested in how the system behaves when the load increases,
we do not define a warm-up period. We also do not define a shutdown
period. Concerning the load, we configure a maximum number of 200 users,
which will be reached after 20 minutes.

This is what the respective configuration would look like:

```bash

#### Generate report from compressed test results (\#192)

The report generator has been extended to read test results not only
from a directory, but also from compressed files, like `.zip` or `.tgz`
files. This is useful if the results come already compressed from
another machine or have been archived to save disk space. The following
archive formats are supported:

-   `.tar.gz` / `.tgz`
-   `.tar.bz2` / `.tbz2`
-   `.tar`
-   `.zip` / `.jar`

Compressed files to be accepted must reproduce exactly the same
directory layout as the uncompressed results, i.e. the archive has to
contain exactly one root directory, such as `20090212-153406`.

Now the report generator can be called either with a directory or with a
file that has to have one of the supported extensions:

```bash
create\_report.cmd ..\\results\\20090212-153406  
create\_report.cmd ..\\results\\20090212-153406.zip  
create\_report.cmd ..\\results\\mytestresults.tgz
```

Note that the time to create the report from compressed files varies
significantly depending on the archive format used. In our experience,
using `.zip` files gives the best performance (comparable with a plain
directory), while `.tbz2` / `.tar.bz2` files need several times longer.

#### Reduce memory consumption during report generation (\#162)

Especially for longer load tests (days), the memory needed to create the
corresponding test report could easily exceed the available system
memory. As a consequence, report generation was aborted with an
`OutOfMemoryError`. The problem was that *all* timer files generated
during a load test were read into memory *at once*.

Now the timer objects are read and processed one-by-one. This means that
the report framework reads a line from the timer CSV file, parses it,
and passes the resulting timer object to each registered report provider
for immediate processing. If a report provider is interested in this
type of timer object, it updates some internal state, and otherwise it
simply does nothing with it. Afterwards, the timer object is released
and the next timer line is read. This way, arbitrary amounts of data can
be processed without any memory problems.

Unfortunately, switching to a one-by-one timer processing model was only
possible by incompatibly changing the API of
`com.xceptance.xlt.api.report.ReportProvider` and
`com.xceptance.xlt.api.report.AbstractReportProvider`. However, your
code will be affected only if you created custom report providers.

##### Migrating Your Custom Report Provider

As long as a report provider calculates just basic statistics (such as
mean, minimum, maximum, etc.) which can be updated incrementally,
everything is easy to migrate. However, now and then the whole data set
is actually needed, for example to calculate the median of values, to
draw a chart, or to generate a sorted CSV file. Storing the whole data
internally in the report provider re-introduces the memory problem, so
report providers are obliged to use as little memory as possible. There
are some strategies to reduce the memory usage:

-   Try to combine multiple values into one.
-   Use highly optimized data structures (in terms of memory).
-   Trade absolute precision for low memory consumption. Often an
    approximation is sufficient.
-   Charts have a limited resolution anyway, so do not draw each value
    but only a few.

These approaches save memory *and* CPU at the same time. The standard
XLT report providers now work this way.

#### API Changes

In order to keep the XLT API as clean and comprehensive as possible,
several classes/methods have been renamed or refactored. Typically, the
old classes/methods are still available (and should still work), but
have been marked as deprecated and are likely to be removed in the next
major XLT release (v3.3.0). Please update your test suite code.

### Bug Fixes

This sections covers all important defects that have been fixed with
this release.

#### Number of active download threads incorrect (\#58)

XLT was not precisely following the static content download thread limit
as specified with  
`com.xceptance.xlt.staticContent.downloadThreads`. This has now been
fixed.

#### Support for spaces in the installation path (\#110)

XLT can now be used when installed in a directory structure containing
spaces. However, it is still recommended to avoid spaces due to added
difficulties when writing scripts.

#### Cookies got lost sporadically (\#198)

Due to a concurrency problem in one of the third-party libraries used,
cookies were removed during concurrent content loading. This problem has
been fixed and set cookies will be obeyed.

#### User did not finish execution (\#310)

It could happen that a user did not end the execution of a load test due
to an infinite loop. This problem has been fixed and all users will
correctly stop the load test at the configured end time.
