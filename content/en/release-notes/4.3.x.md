## XLT 4.3.6

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.6. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/76).

### Script Developer

#### Support Firefox 30 (\#2131)

Script Developer has been made compatible with Firefox 30, so Script
Developer runs on Firefox 17 up to 30 now.

### Framework

#### XltDriver throws exception when JavaScript is disabled (\#2128)

When running XltDriver with JavaScript turned off, several exceptions
might be thrown, indicating that JavaScript is not enabled. This is
fixed now.

## XLT 4.3.5

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.5. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/74).

### Script Developer

#### Drag&drop not completely disabled when replaying a script (\#2072)

When replaying a script, the script itself and all modules it calls (and
all modules the modules call etc.) are locked to prevent them from being
modified during the replay. However, it was still possible to add a
module call to the end of the script by drag&drop. This is not possible
any longer.

#### Command details keyboard shortcut not working when replaying a script (\#2094)

The keyboard shortcut to open the command details dialog (RETURN) did
not work when replaying a script. This is fixed now.

#### Shifting an included command may result in a broken editor view (\#2102)

When moving commands around (via ALT+Up/Down) in included/called
modules, the command tree view could get corrupted. After a refresh, the
view looked fine again. Fixed.

#### Script Developer crashes when recording new commands (\#2121)

It might happen, that extending an existing test case by recording new
commands led to an inconsistent state in Script Developer and it was not
responsive anymore. Fixed.

### Load Test Environment

#### Extended handling of non-responsive agent controllers (\#2112)

The master controller (in auto mode) supports the setting
`ignoreUnreachableAgentControllers` to simply ignore non-responding
agent controllers instead of aborting the test with an error code.
Previously, the master controller did this check only in the beginning,
when performing the version check and the is-alive check. In case an
agent controller became unavailable after these initial steps, the test
failed despite of the above setting. Now, unreachable agent controllers
will be ignored during the subsequent steps (upload, start, download)
too.

{{% note notitle %}}
The setting `ignoreUnreachableAgentControllers` should be used only in
unstable test environments, to get at least some results out of a test
run. Be aware that, with this setting enabled, fewer load machines
than necessary may be available to generate the full target load,
which could influence the measured values negatively. Furthermore, the
actual load may not keep up with the configured target load. Please
keep this in mind when evaluating the test results.
{{% /note %}}

### Report Generator

#### Trend report generator fails to process report directories ending with the same name (\#2097)

When passing the trend report generator a list of different directory
paths which all end with the same name, then only one of them was read:

```bash
> create_trend_report.sh /a/report /b/report /c/report  
Reading report from directory: /a/report  
Creating the XML trend report …  
…
```

This is fixed now.  
Additionally, in the trend report these directories will be named
“report”, “report(2)”, and “report(3)”, respectively.

#### Detect invalid request merge rules (\#2101)

In a request merge rule, the new request name is often composed of parts
of the filter text. These parts are typically taken from matching groups
in the filter regular expressions. For example:

```bash
# add the host to the request name
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.3.newName = {n:0} - {u:1}  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.3.namePattern = .*  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.3.urlPattern = ^http://(.+?)/
```

If the rule refers to a non-existing matching group in the filter
expression (for example, “{u:2}” instead of “{u:1}” in the rule above),
the report generator logged a rather non-specific error message to the
console whenever the rule was processed, potentially one message for
each request. The report generator now detects those kinds of
configuration mistakes early, before the actual processing of data
begins, and quits with a detailed error message.

#### Skip creation of charts (\#2114)

Both the load test report generator and the trend report generator
support the `-noCharts` command line option now. Use this option to
switch off the creation of charts, which might take a while in case a
lot of charts have to be created. This option comes in handy when trying
out new merge rules or report style sheets.

### Framework

#### Cache control header not respected (\#2123)

XLT did not respect certain combinations of cache control directives in
the `Cache-Control` HTTP header, for example:

```bash
Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800 		// OK  
Cache-Control: max-age=604800, public 		// was not recognized
```

As a consequence, it happened that a resource was not served from the
browser cache but was loaded again and again. This is fixed now.

## XLT 4.3.4

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.4. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/72).

### Script Developer

#### Support Firefox 29 (\#2080)

Script Developer has been made compatible with the upcoming Firefox 29,
so Script Developer runs on Firefox 17 up to 29 now.

### Load Test Environment

#### Start scripts cannot handle many arguments (\#2074)

If more than 9 arguments were passed to one of the Unix start scripts
(for example, `mastercontroller.sh` or `create_trend_report.sh`), all
arguments beyond the 9th were not processed correctly. Fixed now.

#### Validation errors in report HTML files (\#2077)

The HTML code of the test reports did not pass the W3C validator, so
post-processing the HTML with other tools was not always possible. All
validation errors have been fixed now. Furthermore, the document type
has been changed from XHTML to Html5.

### Framework

#### Result browser not displayed (\#2078)

Especially search-engine-friendly URLs may also contain Unicode
characters, such as “%u2122” for the trademark character. Such URLs
confused the result browser code: when parsing these URLs for query
parameters, an exception was thrown. As a consequence, the result
browser was empty. Now the parsing code is more robust.

#### Script execution not postponed (\#2079)

JavaScript code may load other JavaScript code by creating and attaching
`<script>` elements to the DOM tree. In these cases, the execution of
the loaded JavaScript must be postponed until the execution of the
loader script has finished. Fixed.

## XLT 4.3.3

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.3. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/71).

### Script Developer

#### Test suite drop-down displays incorrect suite after removal (\#2048)

In case the current test suite did not exist anymore, you were prompted
to re-configure its location. If you cancelled the file-selection
dialog, the non-existing test suite was removed from the test suite
drop-down, but was still displayed as selected test suite. Fixed.

#### Copy/paste not disabled while replaying test case script (\#2066)

Copy/paste activities are deactivated now when a test case or suite is
being replayed.

#### Code export ignores module parameter references for `Eval` commands (\#2070)

When exporting scripts to Java code using the Scripting API or Action
API, the target of all `Eval` commands (e.g. `storeEval`, `waitForEval`)
must be handled differently than other commands since they represent
JavaScript code. In case those commands contained references to module
parameters, the exported code did not take this into account and just
exported the raw target. Fixed.

#### Known issue: Invisible elements react to mouse-over events

Script Developer permits to send mouse-over commands to invisible
elements. That is not correct, because browsers wont’t send such events
to invisible elements. When running these scripts via WebDriver, they
will fail. To maintain compatibility of existing scripts, we decided to
keep the incorrect behavior in place. We are going to change this
behavior with the next major release.

### Framework

#### Agent weight was not taken into account (\#2049)

All agents had a computed weight of zero, which led to an equal
distribution of load even when different agent controller weights were
set. Fixed.

#### Inconsistent results when replaying `Eval` commands in Framework and Script Developer (\#2068)

Replaying `Eval` commands in Script Developer and via WebDriver led to
different results, especially if their target contained backslash
characters or dollar signs. Fixed.

#### Misleading error message in the log (\#2054)

When you took a look at the master controller log file, you might have
found entries stating “Unable to pause status requester for embedded”.
Those errors are misleading since they haven’t been caused by any
serious problem. Removed from logging.

## XLT 4.3.2

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.2. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/70).

### Script Developer

#### Support Firefox 27 (\#2034)

Script Developer has been made compatible with Firefox 27, so Script
Developer runs on Firefox 17 up to 27 now.

#### Make resorting items more user-friendly (\#1962)

Changing the order of test data entries or module parameters is much
more user-friendly now. Simply select the item in question and use the
up/down buttons to move it around.

#### Use native line endings when writing files (\#2036)

Previously, Script Developer always used LF as the line separator when
writing script or Java files to disk. Now the OS-specific line ending is
used, for example CRLF on Windows machines. This avoids issues with some
source code control systems.

#### Write script migration errors to the log (\#2041)

When migrating a test suite to a new script version, Script Developer
used to report migration errors one by one, in separate message boxes.
Now any error is written to the log panel for later review, and a single
message box lists the affected scripts at the end of the migration
process.

#### Script Developer prints incorrect error message (\#2037)

In case two scripts have the same script name, but reside in different
packages (which is perfectly valid), Script Developer nevertheless
showed an error message in the Script Details dialog complaining about a
duplicate script name. Fixed now.

### Result Browser

#### Incorrect parsing of URL query parameters (\#2033)

The Result Browser parses the request URLs to list query parameters one
by one in a separate table. However, it did not only parse the URL’s
query string, but also the fragment (the part following the \#
character), which led to incorrect entries in the query parameters
table. Now the fragment is correctly ignored.

### Framework

#### Web driver features not recognized when reusing a driver (\#2035, \#2044)

XLT can be configured to reuse a single Web driver instance for multiple
test cases. To support this, the driver is wrapped. However, the
wrapping driver did not expose the wrapped driver’s non-standard
features (can take screenshots, has input device, etc.). So taking
screenshots did not work, for example. This is fixed now.

## XLT 4.3.1

This section lists and documents all improvements and important fixes of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.1. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/69).

### Script Developer

#### Wrong code generated when exporting scripts to Java (\#2028, \#2029)

When exporting script test cases to Java code, Script Developer
sometimes emitted wrong code. This happened for

-   macro expressions with nested variables or
-   expressions containing a plus sign.

Fixed now.

### Framework

#### Bypassing a proxy not working correctly (\#957)

When configuring a proxy and defining bypass rules for a certain host
“A”, the proxy might nevertheless be used for that host. Once the proxy
was used the first time (for host “B”), it was always used for all
subsequent requests, no matter what the bypass rules say. Fixed.

#### Assertion failures shown as errors in the JUnit test report (\#2019)

When executing script test cases via the XLT framework, any thrown
exception/error is now passed as is (instead of being wrapped with a
ScriptException). This way, failed assertions are correctly shown as
failures now (instead of errors) in the JUnit test report.

## XLT 4.3.0

This section lists and documents all new features and improvements of
Xceptance LoadTest 4.3.0. Registered customers can see an overview of
changes and view the current roadmap in the [XLT Information
Center](https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/48).

### Release Overview

XLT 4.3.0 delivers a large set of new and improved functionalities.

The **load test report** has been fine-tuned. The most relevant
information is now already listed on the Overview page. This includes
performance summary statistics as well as a runtime and an error chart.
The individual pages for transactions, actions, requests, and custom
timers have been extended by summary statistics and charts. The new
Network page presents all network-related results. The Error page has
been enhanced to give you a better overview of the errors that occurred
during a test run.

**Script Developer** comes with a couple of new features that facilitate
script execution and maintenance. This includes new information, log
panels, and other UI improvements.

**New commands** are available in Script Developer and the XLT
framework. Some of them enable you to verify the style of an element by
checking for the presence of specific CSS classes or properties. The
other ones provide your script with certain variables for further
processing.

The technology stack the **XLT framework** is built upon has received an
update for an improved browser emulation and latest WebDriver support.
Script test cases can now also easily be executed with real browsers, in
which case screenshots are taken to document the sequence of visited
pages. The opportunity to predefine and reuse property sets helps you
manage complex test suite configurations.

The **Result Browser** does not only come in a completely new look but
also with a bunch of improvements that make using it in your daily work
easier and help you find relevant information much faster.

See below for a more detailed introduction to the most important
features and improvements. The new release contains various other
enhancements and fixes, so we strongly recommend to upgrade your XLT
installation as soon as possible.

### Script Developer

#### New Commands

Script Developer now also supports the following assertions and store
commands:

-   `assertAttribute` - checks whether the value of a certain attribute
    on an element matches a certain text pattern
-   `assertClass` - checks whether a certain CSS class is present on an
    element
-   `assertStyle` - checks whether a certain CSS style is present on an
    element
-   `assertEval` - evaluates the given JavaScript snippet and checks
    whether the result matches a certain text pattern
-   `storeAttribute` - stores the value of a certain attribute on an
    element to a variable
-   `storeEval` - evaluates the given JavaScript snippet and stores the
    result to variable
-   `storeTitle` - stores the page’s title text to a variable

As usual, all of these assertion commands are accompanied by their
`assertNot...`, `waitFor...`, and `waitForNot...` equivalents. See the
User Manual for more details and usage examples.

#### UI Improvements

Script Developer has two new panels now. The *Information* panel
summarizes the specifics of the currently selected item (test
case/module or command/action/module call). This way it is no longer
necessary for you to open the item in an edit dialog if you just need to
know its details. The *Log* panel lists all commands that get executed
with their current parameters when you run test cases.

Further improvements:

-   You can now directly execute a test case from the script tree view
    using the keyboard shortcut `X`.
-   The base URL drop-down box is sorted by last usage.
-   When running batch tests, you will also see the success ratio.

#### Text validation and the `text-transform` CSS Property

If an element is styled with the CSS property `text-transform`, then the
element’s text on the screen may have different character casing from
what is defined in the page’s DOM tree. For example, the text may be
displayed in uppercase, while the element’s text is in lowercase. For
text validation, it is important to define whether the screen text or
the DOM text is to be used.

The WebDriver specification mandates to return the text as shown on the
screen. XML script test cases are meant to be replayed outside Script
Developer via the WebDriver API, so Script Developer has to be in line
with the WebDriver specification. Therefore, it will now record text
with the the character casing that appears on the screen and it will
also take the CSS property `text-transform` into account when replaying
text assertions.

#### Supported Firefox Versions

Script Developer has been made compatible with the latest Firefox
version (end of Dec 2013), while support for outdated versions has been
dropped. Thus, Script Developer runs on Firefox 17 up to 26 now.

### Load Test Report

#### Overview

In the load profile table on the *Overview* page, complex variable load
functions are still abbreviated (*Min…Max*), but the full definition is
available as a tooltip now. Being an important load parameter, the
action think time is also displayed.

The section *General Information* contains two new charts; one shows the
response times of all requests, the other one all transaction errors.

The new section *Performance Summary* lists the overall statistics
calculated from all transactions, actions, requests, and custom timers.

#### Transactions/Actions/Requests/Custom Timers

To get a quick overview of a system’s performance, we provide the usual
statistics/charts calculated over all measured timer data of the same
type (e.g. all requests). This facilitates the interpretation of actions
(i.e. page views), requests, transactions, and custom timers.

Runtime charts with large peaks (caused by timeouts, for instance) can
sometimes be hard to interpret because the relevant value range may get
squeezed to only a few pixels. Our new release lets you configure a
logarithmic scale. Alternatively, you can cap the charts. The capping
value is defined by the n-fold of the mean of all runtime values (the
capping factor *n* is configurable). All run time values greater than
the cap are not shown. Note that you can also combine both approaches.

For each transaction type, a new arrival rate chart is available that
shows the actual arrival rate monitored during the test run. This chart
can be used

-   for arrival-rate-based tests to check whether the desired arrival
    rate has been achieved with the number of users configured, or
-   for user-based tests to determine the corresponding arrival rate for
    a certain number of users.

You can now also switch to a certain chart tab, let’s say to the
*Average* chart, for all timers at once by *double-clicking* the tab in
question.

#### Network

The new *Network* page summarizes all general network-related statistics
and charts on a separate page. Note that some information has been moved
from other pages to this one.

The following information is shown:

-   the number of requests made (incl. chart)
-   the number of sent/received bytes (incl. charts)
-   a breakdown of all hosts visited during the test
-   a breakdown of all HTTP response codes encountered
-   a breakdown of all response content types encountered

#### Errors & Events

This page now shows a new error chart that contains separate error
graphs for all transactions/actions/requests so that the temporal
distribution of transaction/action/request errors gets displayed in one
chart. This way you can see whether or not errors of one type (e.g.
action) were caused by errors of another type (e.g. request) without
having to compare, for example, action charts with request charts.

A new error summary table groups all errors by their error message to
help you see which types of errors occurred and how many of them. The
error details table also can be sorted now, for example, by message text
or test case name.

All URLs in event messages are clickable links now, so you can jump to
the respective pages right from the report.

### Load Test Environment

#### Master Controller

To prevent any master controller from communicating with a reachable
agent controller, a simple password-based authentication mechanism has
been introduced. Now the agent controllers may require the master
controller to provide a certain password before allowing any
interaction. The password the master controller passes on to the agent
controllers is configured in `mastercontroller.properties`; the password
an agent controller expects is configured in its
`agentcontroller.properties` file. If the latter is empty or commented
out, no authentication will be enforced.

In case the master controller is running in interactive mode, it
provides the new menu entry

> \(p) Ping agent controllers

This functionality is useful to briefly check whether all configured
agent controllers are reachable and still alive.

Furthermore, the second new menu entry

> \(i) Show agent controller information

allows to query certain information about the agent controller machines
such as:

-   XLT version
-   Java version
-   OS version
-   local system time (and the difference to the master controller’s
    time)

When you run the master controller in non-interactive mode, it
recognizes the new command line option `-noResults` that can be used to
skip the download of results after the test run has finished. This is
especially useful when XLT is solely used as load generator and the
results are gathered by other means, e.g. by evaluating server logs.

#### Report Generator

The load test report generator has new settings in
`reportgenerator.properties`, mainly to support the new features
outlined above:

-   `com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.charts.scale` - configure the
    scale of the y-axis in runtime charts (`logarithmic` or `linear`)
-   `com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.charts.cappingFactor` - defines
    the capping factor for capped charts
-   `com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.reports` - defines the report
    target directory to be different from the default directory
    `<xlt>/reports`

The report generator also offers some new command line options:

-   `-linkToResults <yes|no>` - controls whether or not the load test
    report links to result browsers. Overrides the corresponding setting
    in `reportgenerator.properties`.
-   `-noRampUp` - omits any results generated during the ramp-up period
    to get clean statistics for the steady phase of the test. This
    option is more convenient than the `-from` option as the latter also
    requires a start date/time.

#### ec2\_admin

When starting Amazon EC2 machine instances, you can specify a name tag
now that will be assigned to each instance that has been started. This
name tag can be used later on to filter the running instances, for
example, when listing or terminating them.

### Result Browser

The Result Browser has a new look to match the reports. Further
enhancements are:

-   The navigation tree can be resized (via a splitter bar) to view long
    URLs or action names.
-   The requests listed in the navigation tree are color-coded according
    to their response content type.
-   The first page is displayed automatically.
-   Request and response information is shown in the same tab now to
    save some clicking.
-   Request URLs are links, so you can directly jump to the respective
    page.
-   The start time of each request is also listed. This information
    helps you correlate a certain request with server-side logs during
    error analysis.
-   Request/response headers and parameters are sorted, so a specific
    entry can be found faster.
-   URL query parameters are also listed one by one in an additional
    table.
-   If needed, the content of a response can be beautified for certain
    content types (HTML, JavaScript, JSON, CSS). This includes
    formatting and/or syntax highlighting.

Last but not least, the index file to the most recently created Result
Browser for a certain test case is no longer only located deep down in
the test case’s directory structure, but also in the
`<testsuite>/results` root directory as a more prominent location. This
is especially useful when you want to briefly check the output pages for
correctness because you do not need to go back and forth the respective
result browser directories anymore when running a bunch of tests as
functional test (from Eclipse or Ant, for example).

### Framework

#### Including other properties files

When dealing with different test environments, different load profiles,
and/or different test data at the same time, managing different
combinations of configuration settings can be challenging. To make this
easier and less error-prone, you can now include properties as a set.
This lets you:

-   predefine the configuration of certain aspects with certain values
    in separate files, and
-   reuse and combine the predefined settings as needed with a single
    statement.

To this end, the files `default.properties`, `project.properties`,
`test.properties`, and `dev.properties` can include further property
files. Each of these additional property files has to be placed either
directly in the `config` folder or in one of its subdirectories. Of
course, each included file may also define includes itself.

To include other property files, use the following syntax:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.propertiesInclude.1 = path/to/directory_with_properties_files  
com.xceptance.xlt.propertiesInclude.2 = path/to/other.properties
```

See the User Manual for more information.

#### Type of WebDriver is configurable

When executing XML script test cases, an instance of `XltDriver` is used
as the underlying WebDriver by default. Up to now, you had to write code
to run test cases with another WebDriver. XLT 4.3.0 lets you define the
default driver type in the test suite configuration:

```bash
xlt.webDriver = chrome 
xlt.webDriver.window.width = 1200  
xlt.webDriver.window.height = 900  
xlt.webDriver.reuseDriver = true
```

The functionality to evaluate these settings is built into the new super
class `AbstractWebDriverTestCase` (from which the wrapper classes for
script test cases inherit). This class creates `WebDriver` instances of
the configured type with the desired window dimension. By default, a new
driver instance is created for each test case, but a single driver can
also be reused for all test cases. This is useful for native drivers
since starting a new browser instance over and over again causes the
whole test run to take longer. Be aware, though, that this way test
cases may encounter a state created by previously executed tests cases
(cached content, cookies, etc.).

Note that the new super class may not only be used for script test
cases, but also for hand-crafted Java test cases using the plain
WebDriver API.

#### Taking screenshots when using native web drivers

When XLT executes XML script test cases with a `WebDriver` instance that
is capable of taking screenshots, it may take a screenshot after each
action. Whether or not screenshots are taken/saved to disk is controlled
by the setting `com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk`. The screenshots that
have been taken can be found in the results directory of your test suite
and are presented similarly to the Result Browser for `XltDriver`.

Please note that the size of the screenshot is driver/browser-specific.
Some drivers only capture the visible part of a page, others the entire
page.

#### JavaScript is beautified when debugging

When the JavaScript function call logger is enabled
(`com.xceptance.xlt.js.debugger.enabled = true`) to debug JS execution
in HtmlUnit, the framework will also reformat any downloaded JavaScript
file. Nowadays, JavaScript code is usually served in minified form on
only a few lines, which renders any line number information almost
useless. If the code has been beautified, line numbers are meaningful
again and debugging is much easier.

#### Resolving property keys

When a test case reads a certain setting from the configuration - let’s
say `userName` - the framework uses a fallback strategy when doing the
property look-up. This strategy performs an additional look-up step now,
based on the transaction name (the short name to which the full class
name is mapped).

1.  `TMyTestCase.userName = john` \[property name qualified by
    transaction name - NEW!\]
2.  `com.company.tests.TMyTestCase.userName = john` \[property name
    qualified by full test class name\]
3.  `userName = john` \[plain property name\]

This additional step lets you parameterize different transactions
differently, even if they are mapped to the same class and therefore
share the same code.

Note that this will work for load tests only since mapped transaction
names are not available outside the load test environment (Eclipse, Ant,
etc.).

#### Request ID

To correlate server-side logs and test results, XLT may send a randomly
generated alphanumeric ID as request header or extract such an ID from
an arbitrary response header. This ID is stored as part of the test
results, with a server-side ID taking precedence. Use the following
settings to turn request ID handling on or off, to configure the name of
the request/response header that carries the ID, and the length of
outbound request IDs:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.http.requestId.enabled = true
com.xceptance.xlt.http.requestId.headerName = X-XLT-RequestId  
com.xceptance.xlt.http.requestId.length = 16
```

#### GeneralDataProvider

Two new methods have been added to the `GeneralDataProvider` class to
create unique email addresses for testing with the user name of the
email address containing a UUID. Of course, these email addresses are
not reachable in any way.

```java
String getEmail(final String domain)  
String getEmail(final String prefix, final String domain, final int length)
```

#### HtmlPageUtils

The return types of the methods `createHtmlElement()`,
`getInputStartingWith()`, and `getInputEndingWith()` have been adjusted
to support auto-casting to the expected type, so explicit casts are no
longer necessary:

```java
HtmlDivision div = HtmlPageUtils.createHtmlElement(“div”, parentElement);  
HtmlInput input = HtmlPageUtils.getInputStartingWith(form, “foo”);  
HtmlCheckBoxInput cbInput = HtmlPageUtils.getInputStartingWith(form, “foo”);  
HtmlRadioButtonInput rbInput = HtmlPageUtils.getInputEndingWith(form, “bar”);
```

Furthermore, it is also possible now to find a `<select>` element whose
name starts with a given prefix:

```java
HtmlSelect select = HtmlPageUtils.getSelectStartingWith(form, “foo”);
```

### API and Behavioral Changes

#### HtmlUnit

An API change in HtmlUnit’s `HtmlPage` class may cause compile errors
since the type of the return values has changed:

|                                                   |                            |                           |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
|                                  | ***Return Type***          |                           |
| ***Method Name***						| **XLT 4.2.x**                                      | **XLT 4.3.x**               |                           
| `getElementById`                                  | `HtmlElement`              | `DomElement`              |
| `getElementByName`                                | subclass of `HtmlElement`  | subclass of `DomElement`  |
| `getElementsByName`                               | `List<HtmlElement>`        | `List<DomElement>`        |
| `getElementsByTagName` / `getElementsByTagNameNS` | `DomNodeList<HtmlElement>` | `DomNodeList<DomElement>` |
| `getElementsByIdOrName`                           | `List<HtmlElement>`        | `List<DomElement>`        |

For all of these methods exists an appropriate `getHtmlElement*` variant
that behaves as in XLT 4.2.x.

#### XltProperties

Now the method `XltProperties.getProperties()` returns *a copy* of the
stored properties instead of a reference to the internal `Properties`
object. This avoids the direct manipulation of the properties and
guarantees the correct resolution of placeholders.

Because manipulating the returned properties does not have the intended
effect any longer, you will need to adjust your code to use the methods
provided by `XltProperties`.

Instead of

```java
Properties props = XltProperties.getInstance().getProperties();  
props.setProperty(“foo”, “bar”);
```

simply use

```java
XltProperties xltProps = XltProperties.getInstance();  
xltProps.setProperty(“foo”, “bar”);
```

### Third-Party Upgrades

-   HtmlUnit has been upgraded to version 2.12
-   WebDriver/Selenium has been upgraded to version 2.39.0

### Test Suite Project Template

XLT is shipped with an empty test suite project that can be used as
template for your own projects. You can find this project in
`<xlt>/samples/testsuite-template`. This template contains all required
directories and configuration files, but no sample code or sample
configuration settings. This way it is not required anymore to clean up
your code and configuration after you have copied an existing project
(`testsuite-pebble`, for example).
