## XLT 4.8.3

### Load Testing

#### Similar scenario execution paths despite randomization (\#2900)

In XLT 4.8.2, we fixed an issue in `XltRandom` that caused randomized
execution paths and test data to be less random among virtual users than
expected. Unfortunately, this fix introduced another issue that may
seriously spoil any randomization in a test scenario. After a couple of
iterations, a virtual user just chose from only two different seed
values when reinitializing its `XltRandom` instance for the next
iteration. As a consequence, the “randomness” created this way was the
same in every other iteration. This new issue is fixed now.

{{% warning notitle %}}
We believe that a well-working `XltRandom` is key for successful load
tests with randomized test scenarios. That’s why we **strongly
recommend to update XLT to version 4.8.3**. You should do so even if
you don’t use `XltRandom` directly, as it might be used in XLT
internally.

## XLT 4.8.2

### Script Developer

#### Support Firefox 52 (\#2884)

Script Developer has been made compatible with Firefox 52, which was
released on March 7, 2017. Script Developer runs on Firefox 45/ESR up to
52 now.

#### Provide additional keyboard shortcuts (\#2871)

Now almost all operations are available not only via context menu, but
also via keyboard shortcut. See below for a list of the new shortcuts.

| **Global**                   |                                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| focus search/filter box  | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}F{{< /kbd >}}                      |
| **Script Editor**            |                                                           |
| insert action            | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}O{{< /kbd >}}                      |
| insert module            | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}M{{< /kbd >}}                      |
| insert comment           | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}P{{< /kbd >}}                      |
| **Script Explorer**          |                                                           |
| create new test case     | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}T{{< /kbd >}} |
| create new module        | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}M{{< /kbd >}} |
| create new package       | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}P{{< /kbd >}} |
| run as batch test        | {{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}X{{< /kbd >}}                     |
| rename script            | {{< kbd >}}Alt{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}R{{< /kbd >}}  |
| open data set editor     | {{< kbd >}}Alt{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}D{{< /kbd >}}  |
| enable/disable test case | {{< kbd >}}Ctrl{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}C{{< /kbd >}} |
| export test case         | {{< kbd >}}Alt{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}Shift{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}E{{< /kbd >}}  |

#### Display full package name in tooltip (\#2892)

When hovering over a module call in the script editor, the tooltip now
shows not only the module name, but also the full package name.

#### Resume Replay keyboard shortcut causes script to start anew (\#2860, \#2861)

When the script currently being replayed is paused (manually or when
reaching a breakpoint), execution can be resumed via the toolbar button
{{< kbd >}}<span style="font-size:150%">&triangleright;</span>{{< /kbd >}} or the keyboard shortcut {{< kbd >}}Alt{{< /kbd >}}+{{< kbd >}}F5{{< /kbd >}}.
While the former works as expected, the latter caused the script to
start from the beginning. Fixed.

#### Incorrect determination of element style (\#2869)

When Script Developer needs to determine the visibility of an element,
the result was not always correct. This happened if style properties
were overwritten with an `!important` value. Fixed.

#### Script explorer view not updated when en-/disabling test case (\#2876)

When you enable or disable a script test case, the test case will be
shown either regular or crossed-out, respectively. However, sometimes
the script explorer’s tree view was not updated accordingly, especially
when the corresponding panel is rather narrow. Fixed.

### Load Testing

#### XLT AMIs should support setting a custom agent controller password (\#2843)

Access to the agent controllers can be secured by defining a custom
password at both the master and agent controller machines. Usually, this
involves to log on each machine and change the password manually, or an
automated version of that.

When using our public XLT images (tagged ‘XLT 4.8.2’ and above), setting
the password can now be done automatically for you. To this end, you
need to provide the password as part of the *user data* that will be
passed to each machine instance during start-up. Previously, user data
was solely used to specify custom host name mappings that were simply
appended to the instance’s `/etc/hosts` file. In order to allow for
other data as well, we redefined the format of user data to be JSON with
the following (optional) fields:

```json
{  
    “acPassword”: “<pairing password to connect agent and master controller>”,  
    “hostData”: “<data to add to ‘/etc/hosts’>”  
}
```

Note that in case the user data is not JSON, the data is treated as host
name mappings and will be appended to `/etc/hosts` as before.

If you start XLT images via the AWS EC2 web console, provide an
appropriate JSON string as user data. The image will then parse the data
from the given JSON and apply it accordingly. In case you’re using
`ec2_admin` to start your AMIs, you neither need to remember the format
nor to prepare the JSON by yourself. Instead, you will be asked to enter
password and host data separately, and the JSON is built for you in the
background.

{{% note notitle %}}
If you built your own AMIs, you will also have to provide the logic to
parse the user data and apply it correctly.
{{% /note %}}

#### ec2\_admin should provide a sub-net when starting instances (\#2868)

Our `ec2_admin` utility has been enhanced to automatically specify a
*sub-net* when starting machine instances, because VPN instances require
such a sub-net. `ec2_admin` chooses the default sub-net, or the first
sub-net found if no default is defined (which is the case for “older”
AWS regions).

#### Mask passwords shown in the test report (\#2865)

In case you need to share load test reports with others, you may not
want to expose passwords and other sensitive information, but they
appear in clear text in the configuration section of the report. That’s
why the report generator can be configured to *mask* the values of
certain properties, i.e. their values will be replaced with \*\*\*\*\*\*. Specify
the properties to be masked using a regular expression in
`<xlt>/config/reportgenerator.properties`, for example:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.maskPropertiesRegex = (?i)(password|passphrase|login)
```

By default, any property with the substring *password* in the name will
be masked.

### Framework

#### NPE when invoking a mutation observer (\#2859)

JavaScript code on a page may attach a mutation observer that listens
for DOM mutations. When setting an attribute at an element, the mutation
observer will be invoked, but sometimes this failed with a
`NullPointerException`. Fixed in HtmlUnit.

#### Unknown host issues lead to negative time-to-first/last-byte values (\#2873)

When running test scenarios with HtmlUnit or `XltDriver`, the
*time-to-first-byte* and *time-to-last-byte* values recorded for a
request could be negative. This happened only if the host name of the
target server could not be resolved to an IP address. Fixed.

#### XltDriver does not obey an implicit wait time of 0 (\#2854)

If the configured implicit wait timeout is 0, `XltDriver` did
nevertheless sleep for one round (200 ms) before returning from an
unsuccessful find operation. This made `XltDriver`-based test cases run
a bit longer than necessary. Fixed.

#### XltChromeDriver/XltFirefoxDriver fails to fetch performance data (\#2877)

If there is only one browser window open and the test case calls
`WebDriver.close()` before - or even without - calling
`WebDriver.quit()`, request and browser event data recorded during test
execution was lost, either completely (Chrome) or partially (Firefox).
Fixed.

#### Time-to-first/last-byte values are always 0 for Firefox (\#2879)

When a test scenario uses `XltFirefoxDriver`, XLT records also the
network timings for each request. However, the values for
*time-to-first-byte* and *time-to-last byte* were always 0. Fixed.

#### Implausible request timestamps for Chrome (\#2886)

When a test scenario uses `XltChromeDriver`, XLT records also request
and browser event timings. However, these timings were not always
plausible. Sometimes the timestamp of embedded resources was smaller
than the one of the main request, or the timestamp was even 0. Fixed
now.

#### FirefoxBinary argument ignored when constructing an XltFirefoxDriver (\#2893)

When creating an `XltFirefoxDriver` object using the constructor

```java 
public XltFirefoxDriver(FirefoxBinary binary, FirefoxProfile
profile, Capabilities desiredCapabilities, Capabilities
requiredCapabilities)
```

the `FirefoxBinary` argument was not passed to the super class and was
hence completely ignored. Fixed.

#### Similar scenario execution paths despite randomization (\#2890)

The virtual users executing a certain test scenario chose seed values
from a similar value range when initializing their private `XltRandom`
instance. As a consequence, even if the scenario is heavily randomized,
the resulting execution paths and test data could be the same. Fixed.

#### Empty result browser if strict MIME type checking enabled in Chrome (\#2862)

When viewing XLT result browsers with Chrome, an empty result browser
could be shown. This happened if strict MIME type checking was enabled
in Chrome, preventing Chrome from loading the result browser data file.
Fixed.

#### Frame documents not displayed in the result browser (\#2878)

When XLT result browsers are served from a Web server, document files
for (i)frame elements might be served using an incorrect content type,
such as `application/octet-stream` instead of `text/html`. This causes
the browser to open a download dialog when viewing pages with frames. In
order to give the server a hint about the type of a frame document, XLT
now stores these documents with an `.html` file extension.

### Script Developer

#### Support Firefox 51 (\#2849)

Script Developer has been made compatible with Firefox 51, which will be
released on January 24, 2017. Script Developer runs on Firefox 45/ESR up
to 51 now.

#### Number of matching elements does not correspond to locator (\#2844)

While entering/modifying a locator expression in the Command Details
dialog, the number of matching elements will be updated as you type. Due
to a race condition, the number shown might not correspond to the
locator in its final form, but an intermediate version only. Fixed.

#### Record mode can’t be stopped after switching browser tabs (\#2845)

When you switch to another browser tab while recording a script, Script
Developer goes into pause mode. In this mode, recording could not be
stopped. Fixed.

### Load Testing

#### AWS data centers in London and Canada (\#2846)

Recently, Amazon opened two new data centers in London (*eu-west-2* )
and Canada (*ca-central-1* ). These new data centers are now fully
supported in `ec2_admin`, your tool to manage your AWS EC2 machine
instances.

#### ec2\_admin in non-interactive mode fails to list agent controller URLs (\#2855)

When you use `ec2_admin` in non-interactive mode to start EC2 machine
instances, `ec2_admin` started the instances successfully, but failed
when listing the corresponding agent controller URLs, emitting the error
message “Failed: Format specifier ‘%s’”. Fixed now.

### XLT Framework

#### Certain script commands take longer than necessary (\#1734, \#2850)

When replaying script test cases via the XLT framework, script commands
that check for the *absence* of elements might run longer than expected.
This happened only if an implicit wait timeout is set. For example, with
an implicit wait timeout of 5 seconds the command
`assertNotElementPresent` did not return before that timeout, although
the element in question did not exist on the page right from the
beginning.

The following commands were affected:

-   assert/waitFor … NotElementPresent
-   assert/waitFor … NotElementCount (only when count != 0)
-   assert/waitFor … NotXpathCount (only when count != 0)
-   assert/waitFor … ElementCount (only when count 0)
-   assert/waitFor … XpathCount (only when count 0)

The reason for this misbehavior is that there is no way to check for the
absence of an element other than trying to find it and expecting an
empty result. Unfortunately, when finding elements the implicit wait
timeout kicks in, causing the find method to wait for the element in
question. However, why waiting for an element to be present when we
expect it to be not present?! In these cases, the timeout is
counterproductive and will now be ignored.

### XLT Jenkins Plugin

The XLT plugin for Jenkins has been updated to support the new AWS data
centers in London and Canada.

### Poster Store

There is also a new version of the *Posters Store*, our demo application
shipped with XLT. It fixes a small issue that appeared when load-testing
the store. The corresponding demo test project `testsuite-posters` has
been updated accordingly.

## XLT 4.8.0

### Release Overview

XLT 4.8.0 is primarily a technology update release, but also comes with
some new features. This section summarizes the highlights of this
release.

First and foremost, XLT now ships with **Selenium 3**, the new version
of the WebDriver library. All other core libraries have been updated as
well. This also includes HtmlUnit for an improved browser emulation.
Beginning with this release, XLT requires **Java 8** to run.

The XLT framework also comes with some functional improvements. XLT now
supports `OperaDriver` out of the box and can run `FirefoxDriver` in
either the new Marionette mode using *geckodriver* or in the “old”
legacy mode. When you drive Firefox via `XltFirefoxDriver`, you will get
a much more detailed result browser now, with almost the same request
and response details that you already know from `XltDriver`. Any values
that you programmatically add to the newly introduced value log of a
session are shown in the result browser as well. Furthermore, most of
the XLT framework properties can now be configured not only globally,
but also specifically for a certain test scenario.

For load testers, there is something in the box as well. If you use the
AWS EC2 cloud a lot, you will be glad to hear that the new AWS data
center in Ohio is now fully supported. The load test report has been
tuned to become usable much faster, even with lengthy pages such as the
*Requests* page.

Last but not least, the Poster Store demo application and the XLT
Jenkins Plug-In have both been updated. If you ever wanted to load-test
your WebDAV server, there is now a new demo test suite for that.

Sounds interesting? Continue reading to get all the details.

### Framework

#### Selenium 3

Selenium 3 is now available and bundled with XLT. If you used solely the
WebDriver API in the past, there are no changes between v2 and v3. Thus
no need to adjust your test case code. See
<a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2016/10/13/selenium-3-0-out-now/" target="_blank">here</a>
for all the details.

Selenium 3 requires browser vendors to provide a browser-specific driver
binary. You will know this approach already from Chrome and other
browsers. The driver binary translates the browser-neutral WebDriver
wire protocol into browser-specific actions. Firefox was the last
browser without such a driver, but Mozilla has now delivered. Welcome,
`geckodriver`!

See below for a list of links from which you can download the driver
binary for your browser:

-   Chrome/Chromium:
    <a href="http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html" target="_blank">chromedriver</a>
-   Edge:
    <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619687" target="_blank">MicrosoftWebDriver.exe</a>
-   Firefox:
    <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases" target="_blank">geckodriver</a>
-   Internet Explorer:
    <a href="http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html" target="_blank">IEDriverServer.exe</a>
-   Opera:
    <a href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html" target="_blank">phantomjs</a>

Since geckodriver is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver/status" target="_blank">not complete yet</a>
and may have bugs, Selenium still supports the “old way” where a special
WebDriver extension will be installed into Firefox (legacy mode). Give
it a try in case you experience issues with geckodriver.

To switch between geckodriver mode and legacy mode, change the following
setting as needed:

```bash
xlt.webDriver.firefox.legacyMode = true  
xlt.webDriver.firefox_clientperformance.legacyMode = true
```

But note that the legacy WebDriver Firefox extension is not signed by
Mozilla, so you won’t be able to run your tests against Firefox 48 or
higher as these versions run signed extensions only. Either downgrade
your Firefox to version 47.0.1 or, even better, use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/" target="_blank">Extended Support Release</a>
of Firefox (Firefox 45/ESR).

#### OperaDriver supported

If you want to use the Opera browser for your WebDriver-based test
cases, this is now possible in a very convenient way. Simply choose
*opera* as the WebDriver to use in the test suite configuration:

```bash
xlt.webDriver = opera
#xlt.webDriver.opera.pathToDriverServer = /path/to/operadriver  
#xlt.webDriver.opera.pathToBrowser = /path/to/opera
```

Please make sure you also have the `operadriver` executable installed on
your machine. See above for the download link.

In case you don’t want to use the default Opera installation, but a
different one, or the location of the driver server is not in your PATH,
you can configure alternative paths as needed.

#### Result browser with request/response details also for Firefox

We have improved our add-on for Firefox to provide not only timing data,
but also other request and response details. The response body is the
only piece not available yet. All this data is shown in the result
browser the same way as you know it from `XltDriver` or
`XltChromeDriver`. There is nothing special to do to get this data. Just
make sure you use `XltFirefoxDriver` instead of `FirefoxDriver` when
running tests with Firefox.

#### Timer data in timers.csv

When using `XltFirefoxDriver` or `XltChromeDriver`, request and browser
event timings are gathered. Previously, this data was stored to separate
`timer-wd-<sessionid>.csv` files, while transaction and action timings
went into the `timers.csv` file. Now all data is in `timers.csv`.

Moreover, the recorded browser events and also their names were
different between Chrome and Firefox. This has been unified across
browsers. See below for the list of browser events and their (new) name:

-   DomLoading
-   DomInteractive
-   DomComplete
-   DomContentLoadedEventStart
-   DomContentLoadedEventEnd
-   LoadEventStart
-   LoadEventEnd
-   FirstPaint (only available for Chrome right now)

#### General value log in result browser

The XLT session now features a general value log. Any value you add to
this log will be made available in the result browser. To view the value
log, click the new link with the transaction’s name that is located
above the action list.

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.8.0/resultbrowser_value_log.png" >}}
Value Log in the Result Browser
{{< /image >}}

This feature is primarily intended to aid in error analysis. The data in
the result browser may help you to reconstruct and rerun a failed test
case iteration without having to dig into log files, etc. Simply add any
value of special interest and it will be available in the result
browser. This is especially useful if your test case uses random or
randomly chosen test parameters.

To address the problem with random test parameters, XLT adopts this
feature to make the seed value of `XltRandom` - used for the current
test iteration/session - available in the result browser. To rerun a
test case with this seed value (i.e. with the “same randomness”), copy
the seed value from the result browser, add the following line to your
`dev.properties` file, and re-execute the test as usual from your
favorite IDE:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.random.initValue = <copied seed value>
```

You may also add your own arbitrary values to the session’s value log.
See below on how to get access to the value log and add values to it:

```java
Map<String, Object> valueLog = Session.getCurrent().getValueLog();  
valueLog.put(“user”, randomEmail);  
valueLog.put(“password”, randomPassword);
```

Your data will be stored as simple name/value pairs. Even though the log
accepts any `Object` as value, it still needs to be converted to a
string for proper display in the result browser, so make sure that your
value classes provide a sensible `toString()` method.

Note that in a load test the value log will be cleared automatically
between two iterations of your test scenario.

#### Scenario-specific overrides of framework properties

The XLT framework provides a lot of settings to influence the behavior
of your test cases. Up to now, you could configure them globally only,
so the behavior was changed the same way for all test scenarios at once.
While this makes sense most of the time, there are use cases where
scenario-specific settings are advantageous. For example, if you mix
different types of test cases in a load test (Web interface tests and
API tests), you may only want the Web tests to simulate a “user think
time” between actions. Such a scenario-specific configuration is
possible now for many framework settings. See the table at the end of
this section for more information.

{{% note notitle %}}
This feature had already been implemented selectively for
certain properties, but has now been generalized.
{{% /note %}}

For a scenario-specific configuration, XLT requires you to *prefix* a
framework property name with the scenario name or class in the settings
of your test suite. Let’s use the think time between actions as an
example:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.thinktime.action = 5000  
TOrder_DE.com.xceptance.xlt.thinktime.action = 10000  
posters.loadtest.tests.TRestApi.com.xceptance.xlt.thinktime.action = 0
```

In this case, the general think time is 5,000ms, but will be 10,000ms
for *TOrder_DE* and 0ms for *TRestApi*.

When looking up a property value for a scenario, XLT tries the following
alternatives in this order:

1.  \<scenario-name\>.\<property-name\> - the property name prefixed
    with the transaction name (or the simple test class name if no
    transaction name mapping is present)
2.  \<test-class-name\>.\<property-name\> - the property name
    prefixed with the fully qualified test class name
3.  \<property-name> - the bare property name, without any prefix

See below for the list of currently supported framework properties and
their default value. Properties in {{< ctext color="#888" >}}gray{{< /ctext >}}
denote settings that do not support scenario-specific overrides (yet).

### Load Testing

#### Report pages become usable much faster

Some pages in the load test report are quite lengthy, especially the
*Requests* page. When opening such a page in the browser, it might take
a while until the page is all set up and ready to use. That’s why we
have optimized the JavaScript code on the page so that it takes much
less time for the page to become usable than before.

#### AWS data center in Ohio

Recently, Amazon opened a new data center in Ohio (*us-east-2* ). This
new data center is now fully supported in `ec2_admin`, your tool to
manage your AWS EC2 machine instances.

### Script Developer

Script Developer has been made compatible with the latest available
Firefox version, while outdated versions are not supported any longer.
Script Developer runs on Firefox 45/ESR up to 50 now.

**Update Instructions:** Firefox will not auto-update older versions of
Script Developer to 4.8.0. You will need to do this manually. Please
remove the currently installed version first and afterwards install the
new version by simply dragging and dropping the file
`<xlt>/tools/xlt-scriptdeveloper-4.8.0.xpi` onto Firefox. Auto-updating
within the 4.8.x product line will then work as usual again.

Alternatively, you can visit the Mozilla Add-On marketplace and install
Script Developer -
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xceptance-script-developer/.
Please make sure you uninstall your locally installed version first.

### XLT Jenkins Plug-In

The XLT plug-in for Jenkins has been updated as well. It comes with
small improvements for users who drive their automated load tests from
machines in the AWS EC2 cloud. Now the new AWS data centers in Mumbai
and Ohio are fully supported, and the list of available instance types
has been updated as well.

### Poster Store

There is also a new version of the *Posters Store*, our demo application
shipped with XLT used to demonstrate its features. It has not only got a
face-lift to look more modern, but also provides some functional
improvements. All test cases in `<xlt>/samples/testsuite-posters/` have
been adjusted accordingly.

In case you want to update an existing installation with just the new
`posters.war` file, you will also need to delete the database of the
Posters application because the data model has slightly changed. To this
end, simply delete the directory `<app-server>/data/posters`. The
database will be recreated automatically when you start Posters the next
time.

### Test suite for WebDAV servers

It’s now possible to load test WebDAV servers. We have created a small
library that sits on top of XLT and provides the usual WebDAV commands
as predefined action classes. Simply compose your test scenarios from
these configurable building blocks. The library executes the
corresponding WebDAV operations and takes care of gathering all the
request/response details and timings.

We also provide a demo WebDAV test suite. It does not only show how to
include the library in a test suite project, but also comes with a
simple scenario that demonstrates the usage of all available WebDAV
actions.

The source code for both the
<a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/xlt-webdav" target="_blank">library</a> 
and the <a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/testsuite-webdav" target="_blank">demo test suite</a> is available on
GitHub under the MIT License. If you just want to create test scenarios,
simply clone the demo test suite. Unless you need to modify or extend
the library, you won’t have to clone it too. If you need to do so
nevertheless, please let us know, so all XLT users can benefit from your
improvements. Pull request are welcome!

To conveniently try out the demo test suite, the demo application server
that ships with XLT has been enabled to act as a WebDAV server. The
WebDAV server application is available at http://localhost:8080/webdav/
and https://localhost:8443/webdav/, respectively. In the latter case,
make sure to configure your WebDAV client to accept self-signed
certificates. In order to get access, you need to provide valid user
credentials (use *webdav* for both, username and password). The root
directory used by the WebDAV server to serve all the files is located at
`<xlt>/samples/app-server/data/webdav`. If this directory is not
present, it will be created automatically.

### Incompatible Changes

#### Java 8 runtime required

One of XLT’s main dependencies, Selenium, requires Java 8 now, so we
have to make this step as well and ship XLT compiled for Java 8. Since
Oracle discontinued the general support of Java 7 in April 2015, you are
most likely using Java 8 already, so this should not be an issue for the
majority of users.

#### Timer data

As outlined above, the `timer-wd-<sessionid>.csv` files with the request
and browser event timings don’t exist anymore. This data can now be
found in the `timers.csv` file. Furthermore, certain browser events
recorded for Firefox have been renamed:

-   DOMContentLoaded → DomContentLoadedEventEnd
-   load → LoadEventEnd
