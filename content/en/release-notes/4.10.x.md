## XLT 4.10.4

### Framework

#### Simulation of keyboard/mouse actions on invisible elements (\#3108)

XLT’s Scripting API simulates keyboard and mouse actions for invisible
elements by dispatching keyboard/mouse events.

Since DOM Level 3, such keyboard and mouse events should be created
using the corresponding constructor functions instead of
`document.createEvent('KeyEvents')` and
`document.createEvent('MouseEvents')`. Some modern browsers removed the
legacy API functionality. XLT was adjusted accordingly.

#### Typing into invisible elements (\#3110)

In contrast to the plain WebDriver API, XLT’s Scripting API enables you
type into elements that are not visible (not shown at all or overlaid by
other elements). Because the target element could contain some text
already, the element was cleared first.

Unfortunately, some modern browsers don’t support this operation for
invisible elements anymore. Therefore an element’s content is now only
cleared only when the target element of type `input` or `textarea` is
displayed and editable.

## XLT 4.10.3

### Load Testing

#### New AWS data center in Paris (\#3060)

Recently, Amazon opened a new data center in Paris, France (eu-west-3).
This data center is now supported in `ec2_admin`.

#### Display project name in test reports (\#3057)

If you are busy with different load testing projects at the same time,
you might also have different test reports open in the browser. Since
they all look alike, it happens too easily that you look at the wrong
report by mistake. That’s why you can now name your project. If a
project name is set, this name will be rendered prominently into the
header of each report page (and also the page title).

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.10.3/report_project_name.png" >}}
Project name in the page header
{{< /image >}}

Here is how you would specify the project name in the settings of your
project, typically in file `config/project.properties`:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.projectName = Posters
```

#### Complex Requests page may cause the browser to become unresponsive (\#3039)

Opening the *Requests* page of the performance test report in a browser
might cause the browser to become laggy or even unresponsive for a
while, in particular if the requests table contains many entries and,
hence, there are *N* times as many charts on the page. This was because
the browser tried to load *all* chart images up-front, even those that
are currently not visible (e.g. the ones used only when printing the
page). This has been tuned such that invisible chart images are loaded
only when they become visible.

However, when printing the page, all images have to be loaded up-front
or otherwise they would be missing in the printout. As long as the page
is still busy loading the charts, a message box will tell you that. In
this case, close the message box, cancel the print dialog that appears
right after, and try printing the page once again after a little while.

#### Report generator option ‘noRampUp’ should ignore scenarios without ramp-up (\#3058)

The performance report generator provides the option `-noRampUp` to
simplify excluding the ramp-up phase from the performance report. The
ramp-up phase ends when all scenarios with a ramp-up period defined have
reached the end of their ramp-up period. However, even scenarios without
ramp-up, but with an initial delay, were considered when calculating the
end of the ramp-up phase, leading to unexpected results. Fixed.

### Framework

#### Incorrect encoding of ‘%’ characters in a URL (\#3054)

In case a URL contains multiple ‘%’ characters in a row (such as in
“abc%%xyz”), HtmlUnit did not properly encode them. Fixed.

#### Browser extension does not always report data (\#3056)

When using `XltChromeDriver` or `XltFirefoxDriver`, a special extension
will be installed into the browser to report request/response details
and timings to XLT. However, under rare circumstances the extension did
not connect to XLT, so the data collected in the browser was lost. Fixed
now.

## XLT 4.10.2

### Framework

#### Convenient access to the value of a variable or test data item (\#3032)

In case you need to access the value of a dynamic variable or test data
item in your Java-based script test cases, you can now use the new
method `resolveKey(String)` where you just need to pass the name of the
variable, or test data item respectively, without the surrounding
`${...}`:

```java
String itemCount = resolveKey(“itemCount”);
```

#### Request information missing for the last action (\#3037)

XLT can be used in combination with the [XLT Multi-Browser
Extension](https://github.com/Xceptance/xlt-multi-browser) to run the
same test case multiple times, once for each of the annotated target
browsers. When using Chrome or Firefox with XLT’s measurement add-on
installed (i.e. `chrome_clientperformance` or
`firefox_clientperformance`) as one of the target browsers, you will
also get detailed request and response information. However, although
that data was recorded correctly, the information for the last action in
the test case was missing in the result browser. Fixed now.

#### Exception when taking the final screenshot (\#3029)

In case your Java-based script test case has a method annotated with
@After that starts at least one action, XLT failed to take the
screenshot for the very last action as the underlying WebDriver instance
was closed already:

```plain
Failed to create screenshot  
org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchSessionException: Session ID is null. 
Using WebDriver after calling quit()?
```

## XLT 4.10.1

### License Update

As you may have already heard, XLT is free of charge for load and
performance testing starting January 1, 2018. See our [blog
post](https://blog.xceptance.com/2017/12/21/xlt-now-available-free-of-charge/)
for all the details. Note that we updated the XLT license agreement
accordingly. Please read and accept the new license
terms before using XLT.

## XLT 4.10.0

### Release Overview

XLT 4.10.0 is the first release after our decision to discontinue Script
Developer. Since the export of XML script test cases to Java-based
script test cases is the designated migration path, we have put some
effort into the XLT framework to extend the Java scripting API and to
strengthen the support for Java script test cases in general. For
instance, the framework can now create and handle the underlying Web
driver for you and will also take care of resolving placeholders in
locator expressions or other parameters. The scripting API has been
extended by some new script commands (or rather: methods) to facilitate
writing Java-based script test cases. All script commands are now also
available as a static version that can be called from any class giving
you more freedom when designing your test suite. Also Script Developer
provides an alternative export template that makes use of all these new
features and can, therefore, produce more compact Java code.

The load test report comes with some improvements as well. For each
action the report now lists the Application Performance Index (Apdex), a
standardized metric to express user satisfaction when interacting with
an application. Many values in the Requests table can now be colored
according to your criteria to quickly direct your attention to
problematic requests.

But there is more. As usual for a major release, all core libraries have
been updated. This includes Selenium for the latest browser support and
HtmlUnit for an improved browser emulation. We also have improved our
XLT plugin for Jenkins. You can now use it in Jenkins build pipelines
directly.

Continue reading to learn more.

### Script Developer

#### End of development

As you may have heard already, Firefox 57 does no longer support
XUL/XPCOM-based browser extensions (a.k.a. legacy extensions) in favor
of extensions built upon the WebExtension API. As a consequence, Script
Developer won’t install or work in Firefox 57 and above. Unfortunately,
porting Script Developer to the WebExtension API cannot recreate the
same user experience and functionality. Furthermore, user feedback has
shown that the possibilities of XML script test cases are often too
limited for today’s test automation needs. Therefore, Xceptance recently
decided to **discontinue the development of Script Developer**. See [our
announcement](https://blog.xceptance.com/2017/10/27/firefox-57-changes-and-xlt/)
for how we have come to this decision and which possibilities you have
now.

Please note this does not mean that Script Developer is completely dead
from now on. You may continue to use Script Developer safely using
Firefox 52/ESR for another six months, or even beyond if you take the
risk using a Firefox version that is out of maintenance. We will
continue to ship Script Developer together with XLT and may even release
maintenance updates if necessary, but don’t expect new features.

There is plenty of time for you to plan the migration of your script
test suites. Recommended migration path is to export your XML script
test cases to Java test cases using the export functionality built into
Script Developer.

#### Supported Firefox versions

Script developer runs on Firefox 45/ESR up to Firefox 56. We recommend
using Firefox 52/ESR. ***Firefox 57 and later versions are not and will
never be supported.***

**Update Instructions:** Firefox won’t auto-update older versions of
Script Developer to 4.10.0. You will need to do this manually. Please
remove the currently installed version first and install the new version
afterwards by simply dragging and dropping the file
`<xlt>/tools/xlt-scriptdeveloper-4.10.0.xpi` onto Firefox. Auto-updating
within the 4.10.x product line will then work as usual again.

Alternatively, you can visit the [Mozilla Add-On
marketplace](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xceptance-script-developer/)
to install Script Developer. Please make sure to uninstall any locally
installed version first.

#### Enhanced export templates

Since exporting your XML script test cases to Java is the designated
migration path to keep all your test cases and be able to maintain them
without Script Developer, we have put some effort into the export
functionality in Script Developer.

**Module export as static methods** - We added another export template
‘XLT Scripting API - Compact’ to Script Developer, which exports modules
as static methods instead of module classes. This export variant
produces slightly more compact code which is also better suited for
refactoring, for instance, towards a page concept. However, test data
defined at script modules are not supported when using this variant.

See below for further improvements in the area of Java-based test cases
using the Scripting API.

### Framework

#### Improvements for Java-based script test cases

**No need to pass a driver** - Previously, test cases extending
`AbstractWebDriverScriptTestCase` had to pass a pre-configured Web
driver instance to its super class. Now you may pass also `null` for the
driver or even omit this argument altogether, in which case XLT will
create and manage the driver for you. The type of the driver to be
created can be configured using the `xlt.webDriver` properties which you
already know from the wrapper classes for your XML script test cases.

**Additional methods** - To ease writing Java-based script test cases,
there are some new methods in the scripting API. To simplify access to
certain values (replaces `storeXXX(...)` / `resolve(...)` pairs), you
would now use:

-   evaluate(jsExpression)
-   getAttribute(attributeLocator)
-   getElementCount(elementLocator)
-   getText(elementLocator)
-   getTitle()
-   getValue(elementLocator)
-   getXpathCount(xpath)

To simplify writing conditions in test cases with conditional branches:

-   isChecked(elementLocator)
-   isElementPresent(elementLocator)
-   isEnabled(elementLocator)
-   isVisible(elementLocator)

To bridge the scripting and WebDriver worlds:

-   findElement(elementLocator)
-   findElements(elementLocator)

**resolve(…) no longer needed** - Previously, any `${...}` placeholder
(test data item or dynamic variable) had to be resolved to its actual
value via `resolve("${...}")` in your test code. This step is now
performed implicitly by the XLT framework when executing commands or
standard script modules. To fully support this, some commands now
provide an overloaded version that also takes a placeholder expression
as parameter, for instance
`assertElementCount("css=div", "${expectedCount}")`.

**Script commands callable from any class** - Previously, script
commands were only available to test case classes or script module
classes as their super class provided them. You can now structure your
reusable test code into methods instead of module classes since, all
scripting commands are now also available as static methods in class
`StaticScriptCommands` that can be called from anywhere, for instance,
from your page classes:

```java 
import static
com.xceptance.xlt.api.engine.scripting.StaticScriptCommands.\*;

public class HomePage  
{  
	public static void validate()  
	{  
		assertElementPresent(“id=primary”);  
		assertElementPresent(“css=.header .header-nav-strip”);  
		assertElementPresent(“css=.footer div.footer-benefits”);  
	}

	public static void search(String searchTerm)  
	{  
		startAction(“Search”);  
		typeAndWait(“id=q”, searchTerm)  
	}

	…  
}
```

Just make sure your test cases still extend
`AbstractWebDriverScriptTestCase` as this super class initializes the
scripting engine.

#### Selenium

Selenium has been updated to latest version 3.8.1. Make sure you also
update the driver binaries for the browsers you want to use in your test
cases. See below for a list of links to download the driver binary for
your browser:

-   Chrome/Chromium:
    [chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
-   Edge:
    [MicrosoftWebDriver.exe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619687)
-   Firefox:
    [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
-   Internet Explorer:
    [IEDriverServer.exe](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
-   Opera:
    [operadriver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases)
-   PhantomJS: [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

Unfortunately, `geckodriver` is [not complete
yet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver/status)
and still has bugs. If you encounter issues, you might try running
`FirefoxDriver` in legacy mode. In this mode, a special Selenium
extension will be installed into Firefox that takes over the role of
`geckodriver`.

To switch between geckodriver mode and legacy mode, change the following
setting in the test suite configuration as needed:

`xlt.webDriver.firefox.legacyMode = true  `
xlt.webDriver.firefox\_clientperformance.legacyMode = true

If you prefer to programmatically create your `FirefoxDriver` (or
`XltFirefoxDriver`) instances yourself, use the following code:

bc(java). FirefoxOptions options = new
FirefoxOptions().setLegacy(true);  
FirefoxDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(options);

{{% warning notitle %}}
Note that the legacy mode does not work with newer Firefox versions,
while the latest Geckodriver might not work with older Firefox
versions. So as a rule of thumb, use Firefox 52/ESR if you intend to
use legacy mode and latest Geckodriver/Firefox for geckodriver mode.
{{% /warning %}}

#### Miscellaneous

**XltFirefoxDriver / XltChromeDriver reusable** - The XLT framework can
be configured to reuse a Web driver instance for multiple test cases
(see property `xlt.webDriver.reuseDriver`) saving the overhead of
starting the browser again and again for each test case invocation. This
feature is now supported also for `XltChromeDriver` /
`chrome_clientperformance` and `XltFirefoxDriver` /
`firefox_clientperformance`.

**Reuse Web drivers per thread** - Now the framework maintains not just
a global Web driver instance but a separate one for each thread when
reusing Web drivers. This allows to reuse drivers also when executing
test cases in parallel (in functional tests or load tests).

**Simplify opening the result browser after a test run** - When running
a test case from within your IDE, XLT now prints the path to the
corresponding result browser to the console for easy copy&paste into a
Web browser. XLT may even open the result browser directly in your
default Web browser. To this end, set the following property in your
`dev.properties` file:

`com.xceptance.xlt.results.openResultBrowser = true`

### Load Testing

#### Load Test Report

**Apdex** - The load test report now lists the *Apdex* for each action.

> ***Apdex (Application Performance Index)** is an open standard
> developed by an alliance of companies. It defines a standard method
> for reporting and comparing the performance of software applications
> in computing. Its purpose is to convert measurements into insights
> about user satisfaction, by specifying a uniform way to analyze and
> report on the degree to which measured performance meets user
> expectations.*
> \- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex)

In short, the Apdex calculation for an action is based on a single
threshold value that denotes the boundary between satisfying and (more
or less) unsatisfying action runtimes. From the number of actions that
are either satisfying or unsatisfying, a metric is derived that
expresses the achieved user satisfaction as a normalized value in the
range \[0.0, 1.0\]. The Apdex specification also defines a rating of the
achieved value, ranging from ‘Excellent’ to ‘Unacceptable’. Since Apdex
values are normalized, they can be compared and sorted easily even if
their underlying threshold is different. For more information see the
[Apdex
specification](http://www.apdex.org/index.php/alliance/specifications).

See below for an example that shows the achieved Apdex for different
actions for which thresholds of 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 seconds were defined.
When sorting by the Apdex (or just looking at the colored table cells),
problematic actions can be identified easily:

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.10.0/report_apdex.png" >}}
Apdex for actions
{{< /image >}}

The Apdex threshold is configurable per action, but you can also group
actions by name (via regular expressions) for less configuration effort.
Apdex thresholds can be defined either globally in
`<xlt>/config/reportgenerator.properties` or in your test suite
settings, e.g. in `<test-suite>/config/project.properties`. See below
for an example:

```bash
## The threshold for all checkout-related actions.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.apdex.Checkout.actions = CO(Login|Billing|Shipping).*  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.apdex.Checkout.threshold = 2.0

## The threshold for order placement.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.apdex.PlaceOrder.actions = COPlaceOrder  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.apdex.PlaceOrder.threshold = 3.0

## The threshold for all other actions.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.apdex.default.threshold = 1.0
```

**Colored request table cells** - The amount of data shown in the data
tables can sometimes be overwhelming and hard to evaluate. This is
especially true for the *Requests* table. However, if you have already
defined some acceptance criteria for certain types of requests (or you
always wanted to do so), then XLT can help focus on requests that
violate these criteria by coloring the respective table cells. This way
it is much easier to spot problematic requests when skimming through the
table.

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.10.0/report_request_table_colorization.png" >}}
Table cell coloring for requests
{{< /image >}}

In contrast to the Apdex for actions, where you get an extra value, you
are free to define the coloring for most of the already existing table
columns. Currently, this includes mean, minimum, maximum, percentiles,
and runtime segmentation values.

Table cells are colored based on a certain target value and a lower and
upper boundary. If the actual value exceeds the target, the cell will
gradually turn more red, and if it goes below the target, the report
will reward you with a greenish background. When the value reaches the
lower/upper limit, the background color will stay either bright green or
red.

The target value and upper and lower boundaries are configurable per
request, but, same as for the Apdex, you can also group requests by name
(via regular expressions) for less configuration effort and there is
also a default rule for all other requests. See below for a sample
configuration:

```bash
## Use specific colorization rules for the homepage request and overwrite the default group.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.Checkout.matching = CO(Login|Billing|Shipping).*  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.Checkout.mean = 250 500 1000  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.Checkout.percentile.p95.id = 95  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.Checkout.percentile.p95 = 375 750 1500

## Use specific colorization rules for the homepage request and overwrite the default group.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.PlaceOrder.matching = COPlaceOrder.*  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.PlaceOrder.mean = 1000 2000 4000  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.PlaceOrder.percentile.p95.id = 95  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.PlaceOrder.percentile.p95 = 1500 3000 6000

## Use specific colorization rules for the homepage request and overwrite the default group.  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.default.mean = 125 250 500  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.default.percentile.p95.id = 95  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requests.table.colorization.default.percentile.p95 = 250 500 1000
```

Again, you can configure this either in
`<xlt>/config/reportgenerator.properties` or, alternatively, in your
test suite settings, e.g. in `<test-suite>/config/project.properties`.

{{% note notitle %}}
If you don’t want to highlight requests that exceed/fall below the
target value, simply set the respective boundary equal to the target
value. Typically, you would do this for requests outperforming the
target value, so you can focus on the red ones.
{{% /note %}}

**Drop requests from the report** - By default, the load test report
always contains all requests. They may have been renamed in various ways
via request processing rules (a.k.a. “merge” rules), but you cannot get
rid of certain requests altogether. They are still present in the
summary statistics/charts.

But there are situations where removing requests is desired. Imagine
those spurious socket timeouts spiking high. Once you know they are
there, you might wish to ignore them for the rest of the analysis. You
can now use a special request processing rule to identify the offending
requests and delete them from the report:

```bash
## Delete all requests without a valid status code.
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.10.statusCodePattern = 0  
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.requestMergeRules.10.dropOnMatch = true
```

**Events not grouped by test case** - Events shown in the Event Details
table are usually grouped by test case. In cases where you don’t need
this grouping, you can turn it off now via configuration in
`<xlt>/config/reportgenerator.properties` or, alternatively, in your
test suite settings, e.g. in `<test-suite>/config/project.properties`:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.events.groupByTestCase = false
```

**Peak CPU usage across all agents** - The data table on the Agents page
now lists not only the average CPU usage but also the maximum (smoothed)
value encountered. This helps to spot temporary issues on an agent
machine more easily.

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.10.0/report_max_cpu.png" >}}
Maximum CPU usage per agent
{{< /image >}}


**Omit agent charts** - By default, the load test report contains
several charts for each and every agent. If you use many agent machines
with multiple agents each, the number of charts can grow significantly.
If you don’t need these charts, you can turn them off now:

```bash
./create_report.sh —noAgentCharts ../results/20171110-110432
```

This will speed up report generation and noticeably reduce the overall
size of the report, in case you have to distribute or archive it.

**Printer style** - The load test report now ships with a special
printer style. When printing report pages (or exporting them to PDF for
archiving purposes), the pages will still look nice and show all charts
now. For best printing results, choose ‘Landscape’ and make sure you
print with background colors and background images enabled.

#### ec2\_admin

**More instance details** - When terminating instances or when showing
instance details, `ec2_admin` prints some key information about each
running instance. Now also stopped instances are listed and the amount
of data has been extended to include information about the used key
pair, security group(s) and machine image.

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### XLT Jenkins plugin

**Pipeline support** - Since Jenkins 2.x, build processes can also be
modeled as pipeline jobs. The XLT plugin for Jenkins has been enabled to
take part in such a pipeline directly, i.e. without the need for a
separate job to drive the plugin.

In order to configure a load testing build step for your pipeline, open
the pipeline snippet generator via the ‘Pipeline Syntax’ link and choose
‘xlt: Run a load test with XLT’ from the step select box. Fill in the
plugin configuration fields as needed and paste the resulting pipeline
snippet into your pipeline.

Please note that the XLT plugin runs the load test only. Since your test
suite needs to be updated and compiled before it can be used for a load
test, make sure you have added the necessary steps to your pipeline. See
below for a minimal pipeline that covers all these steps:

```bash
node {  
	stage(‘Preparation’) {  
		// update workspace  
		git ‘https://github.com/Xceptance/testsuite-nocoding.git’  
	}  
	stage(‘Build’) {  
		// compile the test classes in your test suite  
		sh ‘mvn clean test-compile’  
	}  
	stage(‘Load Test’) {  
		// run the load test  
		xlt testPropertiesFile: ‘test.properties’, xltTemplateDir:
		‘/tools/xlt-4.10.0’, stepId: ‘ca68dd47-f99b-4091-a2e1-b29b9c1ad2d1’  
	}  
}
```
