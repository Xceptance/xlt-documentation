## XLT 4.11.2

### Load Testing

#### Always round up when applying load factor (\#3207)

The application of a load factor always involves some kind of rounding.
This was formerly done by arithmetic rounding which means that users
(and arrival rate) were sometimes rounded down and sometimes rounded up
depending on the computed value. As a consequence, test cases with a
computed value of less than 0.5 were not run at all for the entire
period of time the load factor was effective - the full measurement
period in the worst case.

To overcome this issue, computed values will now always be rounded up to
the smallest integer number that is greater than or equal to the
computed value. Hence, users have to explicitly configure a load factor
of 0.0 for a certain test case when they want it not to be run.

#### Increased OS limit for number of open files (\#3193)

The underlying OS of our XLT cloud images has been tuned to use an
increased limit of 128,000 for the number of open files. Unfortunately,
`systemd` did not apply the OS-wide limits when starting XLT, but used
its own settings. This is fixed now.

#### ENA support for XLT AWS images (\#3209)

Starting with XLT 4.11.2, our public AWS images can also be used for
instance types of the 5th generation (C5, M5, etc.). These require the
boot image to have ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) support enabled which
was not the case yet.

#### Distorted listings in ec2\_admin (\#3188)

Some time ago, AWS started to transition to a longer ID format.
Unfortunately, our tool `ec2_admin` did not account for this fact when
listing AWS images causing distortions. This is fixed now.

### Client-Performance Measurements

#### Wrong timings for requests with the same URL (\#3186)

If the same resource (i.e. same URL) is requested multiple times without
a page load in between, our client-performance measurement extensions
for Chrome and Firefox reported all those requests, however, all of them
had the same start time, duration and so on. This is fixed now.

#### Incorrect handling of raw request body (\#3192)

Our client-performance measurement extensions for Chrome and Firefox
also attempt to collect the raw request body for POST/PUT/PATCH
requests. Unfortunately, this approach did not work reliably and often
resulted in a string containing the NUL character ‘\\u0000’.

The algorithm used to process the body of a request has been completely
rewritten to overcome this issue. It will now attempt to decode the raw
body given as byte sequence back to a string if possible, and encode it
as base64 string otherwise.

When inspecting the raw body of a request in XLT’s Result Browser, you
might notice that some parts start with *<span lang="base64"></span>* or
even with *<span lang="file"></span>*. These prefixes indicate that the
decoding of this body part has failed and it will thus be transmitted to
XLT as base64 string, or that this body part was a file upload. If there
is no such prefix, decoding succeeded and resulted in the string shown
there.

### XLT Jenkins Plugin

#### Add option to control whether results should be archived (\#3175)

Once a load test has completed, its results will automatically be
downloaded and stored on the Jenkins master node. This may cause
trouble, esp. when running load tests for several hours and the total
size of downloaded results grows up to dozens of gigabytes. Hence, we
added an option that allows you to control whether or not test results
are archived.

#### Difference report generation on slave nodes (\#3169)

Similar to load test reports, difference reports can now be generated on
Jenkins slave nodes as well.

#### Allow user to specify property file as override for mastercontroller.properties (\#3160)

Sometimes, it might be necessary to use settings other than those of the
configured XLT installation, e.g. default number of agents per agent
controller. From now on, you can do so by simply passing the path of the
properties file to use as override for the properties defined in
`mastercontroller.properties`.

#### NotSerializableException thrown when using custom pipeline step ‘xlt’ (\#3152)

When using the custom pipeline step ‘xlt’ it might happen that a
`NotSerializableException` was thrown causing the entire build to fail
although the execution of the step succeeded. This is fixed now.

### Miscellaneous

#### New SSL certificate for samples app server (\#3138)

Posters, the demo application shipped with XLT, is run on a Jetty app
server which comes with a self-signed SSL certificate. This certificate
might cause trouble with some browsers as it has been issued for a host
named `jetty.mortbay.com` but the server typically runs on your machine,
i.e. on `localhost`. Starting with XLT 4.11.2, the Jetty app server will
use an SSL certificate that is issued for `localhost` and valid to
8/15/2023.

## XLT 4.11.1

### Framework

#### Default request headers overwrite request-specific ones (\#3148)

When using HtmlUnit as the underlying browser, users have the
opportunity to define one or more request headers at the web-client.
These headers are called *default headers* because they are sent with
every request made by the web-client. However, request headers set at a
particular request always have a higher precedence than the default ones
and only those default headers that are missing at the request should be
used. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Fixed.

#### Allow user to turn off event logging for failed requests (\#3178)

XLT automatically logs an event for each request that is seen as failed:
its response status code is greater than 399 or there is no response at
all. This is absolutely fine for most cases. But when load testing a
system that is known to return a status code that is seen as failed for
certain URLs, the overall number of logged events quickly goes through
the roof. This also has a negative impact on the size of both, the raw
XLT results and the generated report.

Since XLT 4.11.1, users can use the newly introduced property
`com.xceptance.xlt.http.requestFailure.logEvent` to disable event
logging for failed requests.

### Client-Performance Measurements

#### Support First Contentful Paint event (\#3153)

Chrome 60 implemented the [Paint Timing API](https://www.w3.org/TR/paint-timing/) which can be used to measure
the time of *First Paint* and *First Contentful Paint* events. Although
XLT’s client-performance WebDriver for Chrome includes support for
measuring the time of First Paint events since XLT 4.6.0, support for
measuring the time of First Contentful Paint events was missing. Now
First Contentful Paint events will be captured as well. They can be
found in the *Custom Timers* section of XLT’s load test report. Similar
to First Paint, the name of the most recently started action determines
the final name of the measurement. For example, if the most recently
started action is named *OpenHomepage*, the corresponding First
Contentful Paint event is measured by the custom timer named
*OpenHomepage \[FirstContentfulPaint\]*.

{{% note notitle %}}
Since Firefox does not implement the Paint Timing API, XLT’s
client-performance WebDriver for Firefox is not capable of measuring
and reporting times for *First Paint* and *First Contentful Paint*
events.

## XLT 4.11.0

### Test Framework

#### Improvements for Data-Driven Tests

**Run test with a single data set during development** - When running a
test case with a data sets file attached, the test case will normally be
executed multiple times, once for each data set in the file. During test
case development or maintenance, where you often need to try and see
whether the test is running okay now, this automatic multiplication
might become annoying. That’s why you can now annotate the test case
with the index of the data set that you would like to use during
development:

```java
@DataSetIndex(2) // use the 3rd data set  
public class MyTest  
{  
	…  
}
```

Don’t forget to remove or comment out this annotation once you are done
with maintaining the test case.

**Data set support in load tests** - When a test case with an attached
data set file is part of a *load test*, XLT will not run it multiple
times, but only once. Previously, XLT did even ignore the test data in
the data sets file altogether. Hence, you would have to provide default
test data in your test case, or otherwise your test case would break.
This is not necessary any longer.

From now on, XLT will inject a single data set from your data sets file
into your test case. You are in control which data set will be used. By
default, the first data set is taken. If the property
`com.xceptance.xlt.data.dataSets.loadtest.pickRandomDataSet` is set to
`true`, the data set is chosen randomly whenever the test is executed.
If the annotation `@DataSetIndex` is present at the test
case, the data set matching the specified index is chosen. Note that the
annotation takes precedence over the property.

**Comment lines in CSV data set files** - XLT now supports comment lines
in CSV data set files. This is useful not only to add comments, but also
to temporarily disable certain data sets without deleting them. The `#`
is the default line comment marker, but you can configure another
character if needed:

```bash
com.xceptance.xlt.data.dataSetProviders.csv.lineCommentMarker = %
```

#### Improvements for Java-based Script Test Cases

**Mouse coordinates as separate values** - Some script command methods
require passing a mouse pointer position, i.e. `contextMenuAt`,
`mouseDownAt`, `mouseMoveAt`, and `mouseUpAt`. These methods have got an
overloaded version. Previously, you had to specify the mouse position as
a single string parameter in the format “x,y”. Now, you can pass the
mouse position as separate coordinates as well:

```java
contextMenuAt(“css=\#foo”, “10,20”)  
contextMenuAt(“css=\#foo”, 10, 20)
```

**Helpful stack trace for failed …AndWait commands** - If an
`...AndWait` command fails in Java-based script test cases, the stack
trace shown is no longer one of XLT’s internal threads, but the one of
the test case thread. This way, it is easier for you to locate the
failed command in the test case code.

#### Other Improvements

**Selenium updated** - Selenium has been updated to latest available
version 3.12.0. Make sure you also update the driver binaries for all
the browsers you want to use in your test cases. See below for a list of
links to download the driver binary for your browser:

-   Chrome/Chromium:
    [chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
-   Edge:
    [MicrosoftWebDriver.exe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=619687)
-   Firefox:
    [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
-   Internet Explorer:
    [IEDriverServer.exe](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
-   Opera:
    [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)

**Change the list of items stored in a data provider** - The class
`DataProvider` reads test data items from a file, stores them in memory,
and returns a randomly chosen item when requested by a test case.
Previously, the list of test data items could not be changed during
runtime. Now, it is possible to add items to the data provider - or
remove items from it, respectively - while the (load) test is still
ongoing. For example, if a certain coupon code is no longer applicable,
the test case might remove it from the data provider so that it won’t be
used any longer.

**Transaction runtimes also in dev mode** - When running a test case,
XLT will store all measurements and other information to the
corresponding `timers.csv` file. However, transaction data was available
only when the test case was run in a load test, but not when running it
in development mode, i.e. from within your IDE or via a JUnit test
framework. From now on, this data is available in any case.

Each execution of a test method results in a separate transaction entry
in the appropriate `timers.csv` file. In case of a data-driven test, you
will get one entry per data set as expected. But note that this feature
comes with some subtle behavioral changes:

{{% note notitle %}}
Any method annotated with
`@BeforeClass` or `@AfterClass` in your test
case won’t be part of the transaction runtime measurement any longer.
Likewise, exceptions thrown in of any of these methods will no longer
appear in `timers.csv`.
{{% /note %}}

Please check your existing load test cases if they make use of
`@BeforeClass` / `@AfterClass` methods. If so,
please turn them into `@Before` / `@After`
methods. This shouldn’t be a breaking change as load test cases can have
only one test method anyway. And in that case, it makes no difference if
you annotate your before / after methods with
`@Before` / `@After` or
`@BeforeClass` / `@AfterClass`.

### Load Testing

#### Success Criteria Validation Tool

In case you do not run your load tests manually but in an automated
fashion, you might also want to qualify the results in an automated way.
For example, if a load test violates some basic success criteria, then
there is probably no use of running further load tests afterwards and
you might want the automated process to fail.

To make this possible, you will need two things: a set of formal success
criteria according to your requirements and a command-line tool to check
them against the load test results. While we cannot really help you with
the former, we have provided the latter - XLT now ships with the
criteria validation tool `check_criteria.sh`. This tool basically reads
success criteria definitions from a JSON file and applies them to one or
more XML files of your choice. The return code of the tool indicates
whether or not all success criteria were met.

```bash
<xlt>/bin/check_criteria.sh -c success-criteria.json -o
validation-results.json <xlt>/reports/20180516-183822/testreport.xml
```

You can use the tool with any kind of XLT reports as they all host an
XML file with the bare result data in their root directory. These files
are named `testreport.xml` for regular load test reports,
`diffreport.xml` for comparison reports, and `trendreport.xml` for trend
reports.

For more details on how to define success criteria and how to run the
tool, see [Success Criteria Validation]({{< relref "/load-testing/advanced/080-ci-cd#success-criteria-evaluation" >}}) in the *Advanced* section
of the user manual.

### XLT Jenkins Plugin

**XLT pipeline step returns a result object** - Since XLT 4.10, our
Jenkins plugin has been able to take part in a pipeline natively. In
this release, we have extended the plugin to return all useful result
information bundled as a result object so that this data can be
evaluated in the pipeline if needed.

```groovy
def r = xlt stepId: ‘any-step-id’, xltTemplateDir: ‘/path/to/xlt’  
echo “Run failed: ${r.runFailed} | Report URL: ${r.reportUrl}”
```

Please see the [Jenkins Documentation]({{< relref "/load-testing/advanced/080-ci-cd#pipelines" >}}) for all the details on this result object.

**Create a comparison report** - Up to now, the plugin offered the
option to create a summary report or a trend report based on the results
of the last *N* builds. Now, the plugin may also generate a comparison
report that compares the results of the current build with the results
of a given baseline build.

{{< image src="releasenotes/4.11.0/jenkins_comparison_report.png" >}}
Create a comparison report
{{< /image >}}

Additionally, you may also specify a success criteria definition file to
let the comparison report be evaluated automatically. See [Success
Criteria Validation Tool]({{< relref "#SuccessCriteriaValidationTool" >}}) for more
information.
