## XLT 5.3.0

See <a href="https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT/milestone/9?closed=1" target="_blank">here</a> for the complete list of improvements and fixes.

### Test Framework

#### Update 3rd-party libraries

The 3rd-party libraries `htmlunit` and `htmlunit-driver` have been updated to version 2.46.

#### HttpRequest: Support binary request bodies

The class `HttpRequest` simplifies making HTTP requests to a server. For PUT, POST, and PATCH requests, the request body may contain custom data to be sent to the server. Up to now, `HttpRequest` supported only strings as the request body, which is sufficient for JSON or similar formats, but not for binary data of any sort. Now `HttpRequest` comes with additional overloads of the `body(...)` method to set binary content from different sources as the request body:

* `body(byte[])`
* `body(File)`
* `body(InputStream)`

See below for some example code how to put the content of a binary file into the body of a PUT request:

```java
HttpRequest httpRequest = new HttpRequest();

httpRequest.timerName("Upload");
httpRequest.baseUrl(UPLOAD_URL);
httpRequest.method(HttpMethod.PUT);
httpRequest.header("Content-Type", "application/gzip");
httpRequest.body(new File("/tmp/123.tar.gz"));

httpRequest.fire();
```

#### HttpRequest: Support file upload

In general, files can also be uploaded to a server as multi-part form data in a POST request. `HttpRequest` supports this mode now as well. All you need to do is populate a `KeyDataPair` instance with the file to upload and additional meta data and pass it as parameter to the `HttpRequest`:

```java
HttpRequest httpRequest = new HttpRequest();

httpRequest.timerName("FileUpload");
httpRequest.baseUrl(UPLOAD_URL);
httpRequest.method(HttpMethod.POST);
httpRequest.encodingType(FormEncodingType.MULTIPART);
httpRequest.param(new KeyDataPair("file", "/tmp/123.tar.gz", "123.tar.gz", "application/gzip", StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

httpRequest.fire();
```

Make sure you use HTTP method POST and also specify MULTIPART as the form encoding for file uploads to work.
