## 5.0.2

Due to some changes in Chrome 127, some features of the libraries we use no longer work in the versions we had, so we had to jump on the update train and catch up to the latest version numbers.

### Library Updates

* Selenide to 7.4.0
* BrowserUp Proxy to 2.2.17 (also changed dependency: now com.github.valfirst.browserup-proxy instead of com.browserup)
* Littleproxy to 2.0.22

## 5.0.1

With our latest release we also introduced some minor bugs. Since one of those bugs allowed - in rare cases - test data to bleed over to another test case, we decided to release an bugfix release addressing our issues.

* fixed bug #266 - no more test data mixup between test cases
* fixed bug #263 - too much log data for catched StaleElementReferenceExceptions
* fixed bug #262 - slight unwanted change in browser config on inherited annotations
* fixed bug #182 - while removing old code we left some (now) unused config files, which might be confusing
* probably added some nice additional bugs to have more fun with the next release

## 5.0.0

The wait is over! Today we finally get back on the major release train and present you the new Neodymium 5.0.0. Back to state of the art technologies with Selenium 7 and JUnit 5 we bring a bunch of new functionalities, improvements and new features.

Did you ever want to follow the whole journey of your automated user through the site? Well we now have a video recording of your testcases added. We improved the selection of tests to run as well as the way we can configure the browser and a lot of other smaller or bigger things to help you with your automation journey.

Please see below for what you can find inside the big box of updated code.

* Update: Selenium 4/Selenide 7
* Feature: Support JUnit5
  * see [here](JUnit#JUnit5) for changes compared to JUnit4

  * Global browser settings like the home page, alerts permission, default folders, etc. can now be set in the properties files of the Neodymium browser properties using the keyword .preferences (Currently, these preferences are only supported by Chrome and Firefox.)
* Improvement: [Filter test execution](Neodymium-configuration-properties#Testfiltering-configuration)
  * Now it is possible to use regex for class name, method name and data set id to filter testcase execution
* Improvement: Configure standard [download folder](Multi-browser-support#Browser-profile-configuration)
  * Only for Chrome & Firefox
