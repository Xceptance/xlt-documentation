Xceptance provides several open-source projects on GitHub to help you get started with Neodymium, whether you prefer a clean slate, a BDD approach, or want to see specific features in action.

## Neodymium Template

* **Repository:** [neodymium-template](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-template)
* **Best for:** New projects.

The **Neodymium Template** is the recommended starting point for most users. It provides a clean, pre-configured structure with:

* Standard directory layout.
* Maven configuration (POM).
* Basic properties files.
* A "Hello World" style test.
* Examples for both Page Object Model and Cucumber.

Use this as a foundation to build your own test automation project.

## Neodymium Example (Pure Java)

* **Repository:** [neodymium-example](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-example)
* **Best for:** Learning patterns for standard Java-based tests.

This project demonstrates a complete test suite for the [Xceptance Posters](https://posters.xceptance.io) demo store. It uses:

* **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainability.
* **Pure Java** (Standard JUnit/Selenide) without Cucumber.
* Extensive examples of flow interactions and validations.

## Neodymium Cucumber Example

* **Repository:** [neodymium-cucumber-example](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-cucumber-example)
* **Best for:** BDD (Behavior Driven Development) enthusiasts.

If you prefer Gherkin syntax and BDD, this example demonstrates:

* Integrating **Cucumber** with Neodymium.
* Feature files, step definitions, and runners.
* Structuring a BDD project effectively.

## Neodymium Showcase

* **Repository:** [neodymium-showcase](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-showcase)
* **Best for:** Advanced features and recipes.

The Showcase is a collection of specific "how-to" examples. It covers advanced topics that aren't always in the basic templates, such as:

* Visual Regression Testing (Applitools).
* PDF content validation.
* Email testing (XcMailr).
* Shadow DOM interaction.
* Working with iframes.
* File downloads.

## Neodymium Library

* **Repository:** [neodymium-library](https://github.com/Xceptance/neodymium-library)
* **Best for:** Contributors and deep divers.

The core library itself. Check this out if you want to understand the internal mechanics, contribute to the framework, or browse the latest source code.
