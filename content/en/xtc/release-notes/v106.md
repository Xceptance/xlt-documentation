## Platform

* When saving the changes made to the description of an existing user group, XTC erroneously complained that a user group with that name already exists. This issue has been resolved.


## Load Testing

* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x → [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in October, 2025**)
    * XLT 9.x → [9.1.2]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_1_x" >}}) (**[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
