## Load Testing

* The XLT 9.x execution environment has been updated to XLT 9.2.1.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x → [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in December, 2025**)
    * XLT 9.x → [9.2.1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_2_x" >}}) (**[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)


## Monitoring

* If updating your test suite from Git takes a long time, XTC will now stop waiting for the update to finish. Instead, it will continue to compile and execute the monitoring scenario using the version of the test suite already stored on disk. This guarantees timely scenario execution, even if the Git repository is temporarily slow.
* Minor UI improvements.
