XTC comes with an Audit Log. Use this feature to learn which activity has been performed by which user at which time. 

The _Audit Log_ page in your **organization** shows just organization-related activities while the _Audit Log_ page in a **project** lists activities for that project only. 

{{< TODO / >}} Which activities are currently logged?

{{< TODO / >}} Build screenshot with neutral usernames etc.

Use the search/filter controls available at the audit log tables to narrow down the list of activities. Entries in the audit log expire automatically after 180 days.

Note that the audit log feature is not complete yet. The activity names and details will be fine-tuned over the next weeks and more activity types will be added.
