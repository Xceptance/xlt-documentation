## Platform

* The user group feature introduced in XTC 103 has been refined.
    * Whenever a user has been added to or removed from a user group, the user will now be notified via email. When a user group is deleted, all members will be notified.
    * The organization audit log will now include entries for creating or deleting user groups. It will also record when users are added to or removed from a group.
    * The project audit log now includes entries whenever a user group is added to or removed from a project. Entries are also included when the role of a user group in a project changes.
    * Starring a project now works as expected, even if the current user is only indirectly associated with it through a user group. The *Last Visited Projects* section on the user's dashboard also updates correctly now.
    * When entering an email address to add an org user to a user group, XTC now suggests all matching email addresses. Note that this works for the first email address only.
* Minor UI improvements.


## Monitoring

* When configuring the activation times of a notification list, the start/end times can now be set more easily via proper time picker controls.
* Minor UI improvements.


## Load Testing

* Occasionally, downloading load test results from one or more agent machines may fail, typically due to network issues or an overloaded agent. Previously, the results from the other agent machines were also lost in this case. Now, however, XTC stores whatever data is available and also creates a load test report from it. To indicate that the results are partial, the dataset and report names include the note "Download from x of y agent controllers failed."
* The load test REST API has been extended. New endpoints have been added that allow to set the evaluation of a load test (summary, detailed evaluation, and rating) or to delete it. For more details, see the [API Explorer](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi).
* The XLT 9.x execution environment has been updated to XLT 9.1.2.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x → [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in September, 2025**)
    * XLT 9.x → [9.1.2]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_1_x" >}}) (**[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
