## XTC v24

### Improvements
Monitoring scenarios may pass the credentials to access a site as part of the site URL, for example `https://john:topsecret@example.com`. When listing the URLs of the slowest requests in alert e-mails or on the scenario execution page, it might happen that sensitive information is revealed. Now access credentials are no longer visible, but displayed in masked form only, such as `https://< user >:< password >@example.com`.
