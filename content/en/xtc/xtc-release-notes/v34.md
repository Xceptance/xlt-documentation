## Load Testing

- Load agent machines now use [XLT 5.4.1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/5_4_x.md" >}}).
- The values configurable in the Load Profile section of a load test (test properties file, test duration, and load factor) are all optional now and can be left blank in which case the values are taken from the configuration files in your test suite. But note that if these values are neither specified in the test suite nor in the UI, the load test will fail or fall back to default values.

## Monitoring

- Now there is an additional chart _Action Errors_ on the _Overview_ dashboard in the _Metrics_ section. This chart shows when the scenario action failed. This allows us to see if the scenarios failed mostly in the same (shared) action or in different actions.

### Platform

- Some cosmetic fixes in the UI.
