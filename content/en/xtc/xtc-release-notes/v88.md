## Load Testing

* Live Error Reporting
    * When using a custom time period, changing the values in the From/To fields using the keyboard had no effect. Now the change takes effect when the date/time input field loses focus.
    * Fixed a problem that caused the histogram to flicker every five seconds while a load test was running.
* Minor UI improvements.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x â†’ [8.4.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_4_x" >}})


## Monitoring

* On the Scenario Execution History page, using the keyboard to change the values in the From/To fields at the top had no effect. Now the change takes effect when the date/time input field loses focus.
* Minor usability improvements.
