## API

When querying load test details via the XTC REST API, the response now includes a `url` field with a direct link to the load test in the XTC UI. See the [API Explorer](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#get-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-) for more details.

## Load Testing

### Improved Test Startup Context

When starting or scheduling a load test, the confirmation dialog now shows the configured load profile settings for your review. This helps you double-check the configuration and avoid mistakes.

### Disabled Hetzner Cloud Shared-CPU Option

Due to availability and provisioning issues, the Hetzner Cloud shared-CPU machine option has been disabled. Once availability improves, the option will be re-enabled.

### XLT 10 Beta 1

XTC now provides an additional XLT execution environment, **10.x**, featuring a preview of XLT 10 for field-testing Virtual Threads support. We are looking forward to your feedback.

Currently available XLT execution environments:

* XLT 9.x → [9.2.2]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_2_x" >}}) (recommended)
* XLT 10.x → [10.0.0-beta-1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/10_0_x" >}})

Please note that moving to XLT 10.x might require a migration of your test suites. Please see [our migration guide]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/10_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}}) for more details.

## General

* The Material UI library has been updated. Some components, such as the date-time picker, now offer improved usability.
* Additional minor UI improvements.
