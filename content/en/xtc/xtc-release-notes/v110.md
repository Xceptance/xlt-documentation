## Load Testing

* When querying the details of a load test via the XTC REST API, the response now includes a direct link to the load test in the XTC UI. See the [API Explorer](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#get-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-) for more details.
* When you start or schedule a load test, the relevant dialog box will show you the configured load profile settings for your review. This helps you avoid basic configuration mistakes.
* For the time being, shared machines in the Hetzner Cloud are no longer available.
* XTC now provides an additional XLT execution environment 10.x. In this environment, a preview of XLT 10 is installed for field testing the support for virtual threads. Use with caution.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 9.x → [9.2.2]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_2_x" >}}) (recommended)
    * XLT 10.x → [10.0.0-beta-1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/10_0_x" >}})


Platform

* The Material UI library has been updated. Some components, such as the date-time picker, now offer improved usability.
* Minor other UI improvements.
