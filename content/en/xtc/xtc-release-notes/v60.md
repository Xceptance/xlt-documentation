## Platform

* It is now possible to remove multiple members from an org or project at once. From the *Members* table, select the members in question using the respective check boxes and click the new *REMOVE* button at the top of the table.


## Load Testing

* Filtering the load test table has been enhanced. There are now two alternative ways:
    * By substring: Enter some text to list all load tests containing the text (case ignored) in their name.
    * By number (new): Enter a load test number, such as 12 or #12, to list the load test with that exact number.
* The *Reports* table of a load test features a new column showing the number of the result set a report was created from.
* Project members with the role *Reviewer* are now able to download a load test report as an archive file.
* When configuring the load profile for a load test, certain load factor values, such as 2.08 or 2.008, could not be entered. Fixed now.
* Stability improvements in the load testing back end.
* Minor UI enhancements.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x â†’ [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}})
