## Platform

* Whenever a project has been archived, XTC will now notify all project members via email and, if set up, Slack as well.
* Archived projects are no longer shown on the main dashboard or in the project selector in the page header.


## Load Testing

* When creating a new load test report, it is no longer possible to specify custom command-line arguments for the report generator. All features of the report generator (for example, a custom time zone) can now be configured in dedicated configuration sections in the _Advanced Settings_.
* Fixed an issue where aborting a load test right after starting it did not cause the load test to stop immediately, but only after a few minutes.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x → [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in October, 2023**)
    * XLT 7.x → [7.1.1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_1_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
