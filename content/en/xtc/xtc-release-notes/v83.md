## Platform

* Minor improvements and fixes that are not user-facing.


## Load Testing

* XTC caches the Maven repository for a load testing project to speed up the build time of your test suite. If the cached repository archive was corrupted, subsequent builds using that archive might fail. In these cases, the build will now fetch the Maven repository anew.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 7.x → [7.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_3_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in May, 2024**)
    * XLT 8.x → [8.1.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_1_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
