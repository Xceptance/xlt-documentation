## Platform

* The usability of the user interface with the keyboard has been improved.
    * The organization and project selection boxes in the page header are now fully keyboard enabled. Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight the desired item in the drop-down list item and press Enter to select it.
* Useful keyboard shortcuts have been introduced.
    * There is the new hotkey <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to return to the *User Dashboard* from anywhere in XTC.
    * Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> to activate the organization or project selection box.
    * Most dialogs and forms can now be accepted with the new <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> shortcut. <kbd>Enter</kbd> alone is no longer supported, as it is often needed to interact with the currently focused input element. The <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to cancel a dialog works as before.
    * Press the <kbd>?</kbd> key to display a list of all available hotkeys.
* Minor UI improvements.


## Load Testing

* New keyboard shortcuts are available on the details page of a load test:
    * Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Right</kbd> to navigate to the previous or next load test.
    * Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to start the current load test.
* XLT has been updated to version 8.6.0, which fixes a caching issue and adds the new Custom Data Logger feature.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x â†’ [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}})
