## Platform

* The audit logs in your org and projects show more activities now and also contain more details.
* Users who have once been invited to join an org/project, but have not completed the registration process, are now automatically deleted after 90 days.


## Load Testing

* Fixed a problem where a user aborted a load test, but the test continued to run until it was finished.
* The build-related steps on the *Status* tab of a load test did sometimes show negative runtimes. Fixed.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x â†’ [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}})
