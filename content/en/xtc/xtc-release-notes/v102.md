## Load Testing

* Since XTC 99, users can be notified by email when a load test finishes. The section for configuring recipient email addresses has been moved to the *Settings* tab. Additionally, the notification email has been refined. It now includes a direct link to the test report.
* Resolved an issue where XTC could not stop a load test or download the results when using machines in Belgium alongside machines in Berlin or Turin.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x → [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in September, 2025**)
    * XLT 9.x → [9.0.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x" >}}) (**[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)


## Monitoring

* The list of scenario executions on the *History* page can be filtered by various criteria, such as time range, scenario, location, and status. Now, when viewing the details of a scenario execution and later returning to the list, the previously configured filter settings are retained.


## Platform

* Minor UI improvements.
