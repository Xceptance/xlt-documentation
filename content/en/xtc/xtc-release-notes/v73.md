## Platform

* The Markdown editor component has been enhanced to support [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). Project documentation and load test evaluation texts can now take advantage of these extensions to standard Markdown:
    * Autolinks
    * Footnotes
    * Strikethrough
    * Tables
    * Task lists


## Load Testing

* Load test comparison reports can now be pinned as well.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x → [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in December, 2023**)
    * XLT 7.x → [7.2.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_2_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
