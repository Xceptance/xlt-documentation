## Platform

### New Feature: Manage Repository and Properties at the Organization

Managing a large organization with many similar projects can be a tedious taks, especially if all the projects are configured alike. Whenever project settings need adjusting, the changes must be applied to each project manually.

To simplify this process, XTC now allows more project settings to be predefined at the organization level. Currently, this includes Git repository settings, as well as regular and secret properties. See the new *Repository* and *Properties* tabs on the *Configuration* page of an organization.

Projects may choose to either inherit these settings from the organization or to define their own. If the settings are inherited, changes made at the organization level are effective immediately for all projects using them.

Note that certain details can still be customized for a project, even if the settings are basically inherited from the organization. For the Git repository, the project can specify a custom branch, while the repository URL and authentication are inherited. For regular or secret properties, projects can define properties that are always added on top of the inherited properties.


## Load Testing

* Load tests can now both inherit properties from their project *and* add their own properties on top of the inherited ones.
* The load test REST API has been extended:
    * The Git repository branch to use when executing a load test can now be set via the API. For more details, see the "update" variant of the [load test action endpoint](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#post-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-) in the API explorer.
    * The details of a load test report now contain additional URLs. One is the URL of the browseable report. There are also URLs where you can download the `testreport.xml` and the `scorecard.xml` files of that report via the REST API. See the [load test information endpoint](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#get-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-) in the API explorer. Use these two files as input if you plan to automatically evaluate the results of a load test.
    * Two corresponding API endpoints are now available for downloading the [`testreport.xml`](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#get-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-/reports/-report-/test-report) and the [`scorecard.xml`](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi#get-/public/api/v2/orgs/-org-/projects/-project-/load-tests/-id-/reports/-report-/scorecard) files of a load test report.
* When configuring agent machines for a load test, XTC will no longer require you to enter the number of agents per machine. Instead, 1 is now the default value. This change is intended to prevent errors, since multi-agent setups are uncommon. However, you can still enter a higher number for the agent count. In this case, XTC will remind you to review the JVM memory settings in your test suite.
* When setting the load factor in the *Load Profile* section of a load test, you can now enter a [relative load function]({{< relref "/xlt/load-testing/manual/470-load-configuration/#relative-load-function-definition" >}}) as an alternative to static values or absolute load functions.
* The XLT 9.x execution environment is now recommended and the default for new projects. It has been updated to XLT version 9.1.1.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x → [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in September, 2025**)
    * XLT 9.x → [9.1.1]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_1_x" >}}) (**[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/9_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
