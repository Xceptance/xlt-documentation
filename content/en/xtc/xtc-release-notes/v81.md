## Platform

* API v2 (still in preview)
    * The URLs of all existing API endpoints have been changed. We have reintroduced the `orgs` path element, so URLs now start with `/public/api/v2/orgs/{org}/...`.
    * The API endpoints listing projects and load tests support paging. The paging responses have been enhanced with more details. This includes:

        * The offset, limit, and size of the current page.
        * The URL of the next and previous page.
        * Base and self URLs.

      See the [API Explorer](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi) for details.
* In the [API Explorer](https://xtc.xceptance.com/exploreApi), all endpoints now list the scopes required to call that endpoint more prominently in the description.
* The system notification window has been redesigned for more clarity.


## Load Testing

* The charts on the Project Dashboard can now shrink a bit before wrapping to a new row, so the three charts typically fit in one row even on smaller screens.
* When overriding the load profile settings in your test suite for a particular load test, you must now specify a value for each parameter, including the ramp-up and shutdown times. This is to ensure that the resulting load curve is exactly as shown in the graph.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 7.x → [7.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_3_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in May, 2024**)
    * XLT 8.x → [8.1.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_1_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
