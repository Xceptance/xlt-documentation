## XTC v18

### Improvements
- Sometimes you need to know the **IP addresses of the executor machines** on which your monitoring scenarios will be run, for example if you want to exclude the monitoring traffic from your statistics. The list of IP addresses can now be found on the *General* tab in the configuration area of your monitoring project. Typically, there is one IP address per provisioned monitoring location per project.
