## Fixes
- If default monitoring scenario settings have been overwritten for a certain scenario, the UI usually shows a "Defaults overwritten" text next to the scenario name. However, this did not happen if the reply-to address for alert emails was overwritten. This is fixed now.
- The name of a monitoring scenario must be unique in a project. When creating or renaming a scenario using an already existing name, the user received either an empty error page or no visible reaction at all. Now a proper input validation error message is shown in the UI.
