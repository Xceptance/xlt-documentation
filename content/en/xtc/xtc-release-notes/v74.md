## Platform

* Inactive projects can now be deleted from the *Projects* page in your organization. Archived projects must still be made active (or inactive) before they can be deleted.
* Various minor UI improvements.


## Load Testing

* The *Dashboard* page of a load testing project now lists the most important load tests and reports. This currently includes:
    * The last executed and upcoming (i.e. scheduled) load tests.
    * All pinned load tests.
    * All pinned load test reports.
* When creating a custom load test report, the *Create Report* dialog now displays the result from which the report will be created in the dialog title. Use this information to verify that you have selected the correct result.
* The load testing backend now uses UTF-8 as the default platform encoding again. This fixes these issues:
    * Special characters in Java source files in your test suite may have been misinterpreted if your pom.xml file did not specify a source file encoding.
    * Chart files with German umlauts in their names would not load when viewing a load report.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x → [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in December, 2023**)
    * XLT 7.x → [7.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_3_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
