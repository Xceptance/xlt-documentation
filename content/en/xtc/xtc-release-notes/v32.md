## Load Testing

- When duplicating an existing load test, you no longer need to change the name or description to be able to submit the dialog.
- Fixed an issue with report sharing. Intermediate and custom load test reports could no longer be shared.

## Monitoring

- Improved the server performance when viewing the list of scenario executions on the _History_ page.
- Stabilized the scenario execution export feature.

## Platform

Fixed an issue with account activation. When the user received an account activation email and clicked the activation link in the email, the server sometimes responded with "The activation code is no longer valid."
