## Platform

* When you try to add API credentials with the same name as already existing credentials, the server rejects that request as expected. However, an additional error trace was logged to the browser console. Fixed now.
* Previously, when a project was set to inactive, the project dashboard displayed a "Project is inactive" text. This text has been removed because the navigation bar on the left already contains a red project-is-inactive indicator.


## Load Testing

* Fixed some usability issues when trying to bulk-delete pinned items that occurred because pinned items cannot be deleted.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 7.x â†’ [7.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_3_x" >}})
