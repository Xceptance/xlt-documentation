## Platform

* Audit Log
    * Now the audit logs in your org and projects show even more activities.
    * Many audit events contain more details now.
* The sorting order of table items was not always stable, especially when paging. Fixed.


## Load Testing

* The overview chart on the *Scenario Status* tab of a load test has been improved.
    * In the scenario selection drop-down, there is now a *Select All* item to quickly (de)select all series at once.
    * The special scenario "all" representing the sum of running/total users of all scenarios has been renamed to "Totals".
    * Fixed an issue with the total users series of the "all" scenario always being 0.
    * Minor visual improvements.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x â†’ [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}})
