## Improvements
- The time interval input (as used to define the execution interval of monitoring scenarios, for example), is more user-friendly now. When using the up/down arrows in the graphical editor, the value now wraps around if it has reached the maximum/minimum value.
### Fixes
- Since the introduction of the System Notification feature, a browser session did no longer expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Number inputs now show a meaningful error message if the entered value cannot be parsed as a number.
