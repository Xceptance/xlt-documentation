## XTC v33.2

2021-05-06

### Load Testing

- Fixed an issue with report sharing. Intermediate and custom load test reports could no longer be shared.

## XTC v33

2021-05-04

### Load Testing

- Features that are not complete yet are no longer exposed in the UI. This includes the _Unattended Execution_ and _AWS Machines_ sections on the _Settings_ tab of a load test and the _Live Metrics_ tab.
- When displaying the names of load tests, longer names are now properly truncated.
- Once a load test has been started, the _Common Machine Configuration_ section on the _Settings_ tab of that load test will now become read-only as any other section on this tab.
- The version of XLT used to control the actual load test and to create load test reports has been updated to 5.4.0.

### Monitoring

- On the _History_ page, the scenario executions of a project can be filtered by various criteria, for example by their start time using the time range filter. Previously, the time range filter was initially set to show all executions, but has now been adjusted to show the executions of the last 24 hours only. Note that this change affects just the initial time range. You can still reduce or extend the time range as needed.
