## Platform

* We have finished our table refresh. All tables now feature a denser design and use paging instead of endless scroll.
* The organization role *Billing Admin* has been renamed to *Billing Manager*. The new name better expresses that billing managers may see billing-related pages, but otherwise don't have any administrative privileges in the organization.
* Minor UI fixes and improvements.


## Load Testing

* The creation of an interim report for a load test did sometimes fail with an error saying that another interim report is currently being created although that was not the case. Fixed now.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x â†’ [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}})
