## Load Testing

* The *Dashboard* page of a load testing project now shows some charts to visualize how many load tests have a certain state or rating.
* The *Recent Load Tests* section of the *Dashboard* page has been enhanced. It now shows all load tests in the last 24 hours or, if there were none, the most recent load test.
* The *Status* tab of a load test has been redesigned to be more compact and to better match the design of all other load test tabs.
* The *Reports* tab on the *Comparison* page no longer lists all the reports in a project to choose from when creating a comparison report. Instead, you must explicitly select each report of interest to appear on the *Reports* tab. To do this, go to a load test report and click the *To Be Compared* context menu item. The report can be deselected again from this context menu, but it can also be removed from the *Reports* tab on the *Comparison* page.
* When viewing a load test report, chart files with a '+' character in their name would not load. Fixed now.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x → [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}}) (deprecated, will be **retired in December, 2023**)
    * XLT 7.x → [7.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_3_x" >}}) (recommended, but **[migration needed]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/7_0_x#test-suite-migration" >}})**)
