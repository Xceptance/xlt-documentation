## Load Testing

* When scheduling a load test to run at a later time, it is now possible to select the time zone in addition to the start time. Start times are usually communicated in local time within your team, so this change makes scheduling a load test less error-prone because you no longer have to convert the time to UTC.
* The _Error Reporting_ tab of a load test has been improved. When expanding an error entry, a wider stack trace no longer causes the table to grow to the right, pushing the collapse button out of the window. Instead, the stack trace gets a proper scrollbar.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x â†’ [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}})
