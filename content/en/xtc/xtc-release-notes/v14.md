## XTC v14

### New Features

- With *System Notifications* we introduced a mechanism to communicate important information to all users of XTC, for example if a system maintenance is planned or if a new version of XTC was deployed. Once read, system notifications don't go away, but are still available for a certain amount of time. Note that system notifications cannot be sent by regular users of XTC.

### Improvements
- When sorting table entries by E-mail, the sorting is case-insensitive now.
- When filtering table entries by a substring, all tables supporting this feature behave similarly now.
