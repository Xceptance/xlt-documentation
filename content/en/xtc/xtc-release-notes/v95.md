## Monitoring

### New Feature: Selective and Flexible Monitoring Alerts

*Work in progress. Please check back later.*
 
### Other Changes

* The instrumentation of monitoring projects for audit logging has been extended significantly.
* The histogram charts on the *Dashboard* and *History* pages have been improved.
    * The x-axis now displays the current day. This helps to better understand the data when the selected time range spans multiple days.
    * The tooltip over a histogram bar now shows the time range represented by the bar.


## Load Testing

* The new Alt+Enter shortcut now also works in the *Schedule Load Test* dialog.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x â†’ [8.6.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_6_x" >}})


## Platform

* When you duplicate a project, the project documentation is now duplicated as well.
* Minor UI improvements.
