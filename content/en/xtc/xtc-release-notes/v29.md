This is the first public release of XTC in a while. We have been busy integrating the new **Load Testing** feature, the second major feature module of XTC besides Monitoring. This new module enables you to:

- organize your load testing activities with Load Testing projects
- create, configure, and run large-scale [XLT-based](https://www.xceptance.com/en/xlt/) load tests
- collect and share load test results and reports

Note that the Load Testing feature is currently in beta and therefore visible to a restricted audience only.

Noteworthy changes in the **Monitoring** module:
- Git repository URLs may no longer contain user information since authentication details are always configured in the separate Authentication section.
