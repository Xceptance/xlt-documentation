## Platform

* The audit logs in your org and projects show more activities now and also contain more details.


## Load Testing

* In the chart on the *Scenario Status* tab of a load test, the different scenario lines did sometimes switch their color, esp. when changing the set of scenarios to be shown. Fixed now.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 6.x ΓåÆ [6.2.4]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/6_2_x" >}})
