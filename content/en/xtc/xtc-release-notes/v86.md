## Load Testing

* The machines and machine settings to use for a load test have been moved from the *Settings* tab to the new *Machines* tab.
  * To ease transition, the *Machines* section on the *Settings* tab is still present but shows only a hint about where machines can be configured from now on.
* When removing one or more load test results, reports or even load tests, the view was not updated properly. This is fixed now.
* Fixed an issue where sharing of *Comparison Report*s in inactive load testing projects seemed to be possible although it should not.
  * The *Share* context menu could be clicked on and lead to an error message when doing so. It will now be disabled in case the project is inactive.
* Currently available XLT execution environments:
    * XLT 8.x â†’ [8.3.0]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/8_3_x" >}})

## Other Changes

* The superfluous headline on the organization's dashboard page above the project tiles has been removed as it did not serve any purpose (other than eating space).
