### Metrics

In addition to the data provided in _History_, in **Metrics** you will find a graphical dashboard for your monitoring project.

The Overview page of the metrics dashboard.

This dashboard visualizes the most interesting measurements over time so you can spot trends or periods of slowness more easily.

Currently you can not configure this dashboard. XTC offers a default dashboard for every monitoring project it runs.
