## What is XTC?

XTC allows you to be ahead of performance and stability issues by using a centralized testing platform that offers fine-grained control, maximum scale, and a unique monitoring approach.

XTC (**X**ceptance **T**est **C**enter) is an SaaS offering that delivers XLT as a service. It increases efficiency, lowers the time to test, and enables you to do all things you might have been doing [manually before]({{< relref "test-execution" >}}). It allows you to:

* manage your load test projects,
* set up, configure, and run load tests,
* evaluate load test runs and share the results, and
* run continuous monitoring using browser-based test automation.

XTC load and monitoring service are based fully on [XLT]({{< relref "/xlt/" >}}), hence everything you know about load testing with XLT is still valid. [Test development]({{< relref "test-development" >}}) still takes place in your IDE and test suites live in your preferred GIT repo.

XTC helps you to speed up the more tedious tasks of load testing:

* It simplifies the test setup, allows to duplicate tests, comment on the setup as well as on the results.
* It starts and stops all agent machines for you. You only have to define where you want the agents to be placed and how many agent you need.
* It automatically starts and stops a test, collects all results, and creates a report.
* It allows to share a test result quickly either as a secret public link or within your project setup.

XTC is getting better while you are reading this. Checkout the release notes [to see what's new]({{< relref "/xtc/xtc-release-notes/" >}})!
