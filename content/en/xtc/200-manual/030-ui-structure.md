## Selecting a Project

After logging in to XTC, you will see a dashboard containing the organizations and projects you are  a member of. You can select both via dashboard links or by clicking the links in the header next to the _XTC_ logo:

The XTC top menu allows you to select organization and project directly.

Please note that the menu on the left offers different options depending on whether you are currently viewing the dashboard, an organization, or a project.

To set up any kind of test, either for load testing or monitoring, you need to navigate to the right project. A project can either be for load testing or for monitoring, never for both at the same time. The project type will be indicated in the project tile:

{{< image src="xtc/organizations_monitoringProject.png" >}}
A monitoring project on the dashboard of the _Xceptance_ organization.

The project menu on the left side will look a bit different depending on whether you selected a load testing or a monitoring project:

{{< image src="xtc/project_menus.png" >}}
The menu of a monitoring project (left) and a load testing project (right).
{{< /image >}}

In any case, you will see the project _Members_ and the _Configuration_.
