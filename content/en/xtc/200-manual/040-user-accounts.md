## Creating a User Account

To use Xceptance Test Center, you need a user account. You can easily sign up on https://xtc.xceptance.com/. You will be prompted to enter your name, mail address and password.

Currently, your role and projects will be assigned by Xceptance. This will change in the future.

### Sign Up Using SSO

Instead of creating a user account with XTC, you have the option to use an external login provider (Google or Microsoft) for SSO. To do this, select "Sign up with Google" or "Sign up with Microsoft" on the registration page. You will then be taken to Google's or Microsoft's login page to confirm which account you want to use for SSO.
