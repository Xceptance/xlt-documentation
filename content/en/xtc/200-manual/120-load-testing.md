## XTC Load Testing Basics

To run a load test in XTC, we assume you have an [XLT Test Suite](../../../load-testing/manual/060-test-development/) available in the [repository](#select-the-test-suite-repository) of your choice. (For more information on what to prepare and think about before load testing, see our recommendations for a load testing [workflow](../../../load-testing/manual/050-workflow/).)

XTC enables you to quickly get an [overview of previous test runs](../01-features/#view-load-tests-in-xtc), offering plenty of information. 

Below we will show you how to [run a load test with XTC](#run-a-load-test), which usually consists of the following steps which you can also learn more about in the [load testing documentation](../../../load-testing):

* [create a new load test run](#create-a-new-load-test),
* adjust the [test settings](#test-settings) for this run, 
* [start the load test](#start-the-load-test),
* [monitor](#monitor-the-test) your test while it's running,
* [create test reports](#create-a-report) and
* [evaluate](#evaluate-the-test-run) the test results.

## Define the Test Suite Repository

As the very first step of every test run, XTC will download your test suite from the repository you defined for the project. The repository itself will be defined for the test project, while the repository branch used in a test run can also be overridden in the [test settings](#test-settings) if needed.

Select **Configuration** in the menu on the left to check in the _Repository_ tab whether the [project repository and branch](../../010-xtc-basics/#repository-authentication) for the test suite is correctly set and can be accessed using the provided authentication.

## Run a Load Test

### Create a New Load Test

To create a new load test, navigate to the _Load Tests_ overview of your load test project. You can either duplicate (and probably edit) an existing test run, or create a completely new test setup:

{{< image src="xtc/loadtest_newOrDuplicate.png" >}}
Create a new load test or duplicate an existing one.
{{< /image >}}

You will be prompted to enter a name and description for the new load test. XTC will then either make a copy of the selected test or create a completely new test with default settings under the chosen name. The test status will be _New_ either way. 

You can then enter the configuration by clicking the name of the newly created test, which will take you to the settings of this test.

### Test Settings

The _Settings_ tab contains all settings for the test run. Some of these are mandatory, you need to set them before the test run can be started.

#### Load Profile

Under _Load Profile_ you can override the settings in your test suite for the [test properties file to be used](../../../load-testing/manual/480-test-suite-configuration/#test-properties-file). In addition to that, you can override the settings for test duration and [load factor](../../../load-testing/manual/470-load-configuration/#load-factor). All other settings, for example, [ramp-up times](../../../load-testing/manual/470-load-configuration/#ramp-up-load-profile), are not directly configurable in the UI yet, but are still read from the properties files in your test suite.

The load profile settings are only needed if you want to override your test suite settings for some reason, e.g. quickly changing the test duration or load factor without pushing changes to the repository, or switching between your prepared test property files. If the fields are left empty, the settings in the test suite will be used.

Learn more in our _Load Testing_ section about [configuring load profiles](../../../load-testing/manual/470-load-configuration) for your test run.

#### Repository

Under _Repository_ you can enter a branch of the project repository to be used for this test run. This is only necessary if you want to use another branch than the one you [configured for the project](#define-the-test-suite-repository). If this is left empty, the project or default branch will be used.

#### Machine Configuration

The most important (and mandatory) part of the test setup is the configuration of the test machines to be used. 

In _Common Machine Configuration_ you can enter a password for the communication between the master and all agent machines (a random password will be generated by default).

The machines to be used can be entered in _Google Machines_ or _Custom Machines_ (or you use a combination of both). 

If you want to use machines in the **Google Cloud**, you just enter configuration details and the selected machines will automatically be started prior to the load test and terminated afterwards by XTC. To edit the Google Cloud machine configuration, click the editing button next to the _Google Machines_ headline. There you can
* specify which _regions_ the machines should run in (you can pick several, the machines will be spread over the selected regions as evenly as possible), 
* pick an _instance template_ for your machines (currently tiny, small, medium or xlarge), depending on how much computing power you think you'll need,
* select the number of machine instances to start (_instance count_), and
* select the number of _agents per instance_.

Instead of starting and terminating Google Machines per XTC, you can also use other machines for testing. You can define these in **Custom Machines**: just enter a list of host names and the agents per instance for your machines, and make sure these are running while the test is executed. 

As **[test sizing](../../../load-testing/how-tos/test-sizing/)** is a whole topic in itself, you might want to check the CPU usage after your test and maybe adjust the number of machines for the next test run.

#### Properties
In _Properties_ and _Secret Properties_ you may overwrite [properties](../../../load-testing/manual/480-test-suite-configuration/) for test execution. If nothing is set here, the properties from the project repository will be used. Properties may also be overwritten globally for all load tests of this project in the [project configuration](../../010-xtc-basics/#properties).

### Start the Load Test

To actually start the load test, click the link on top of the load test contents:

{{< image src="xtc/loadtest_start.png" >}}
Start the configured load test.
{{< /image >}}

You will be prompted to confirm that you want to start the load test with the given settings now. If you click _Start Load Test_ XTC will start the load test by downloading the current state of the test suite project from the repository, building the project, provisioning the requested agents and, if this was successful, run the provided test scenarios for the configured time.

<!--Soon (?) to come: test scheduling-->

### Monitor the Test 

The _Status_ tab contains an overview of the test status. This is a list of the steps carried out in the load test phases _Preparation_, _Execution_,  and _Results and Clean Up_ which will be marked done while the test progresses. 

{{< image src="xtc/loadtest_status.png" >}}

{{< /image >}}

Steps that failed due to errors (like timeouts or failed authentication) will be marked as failed here, so you can see why and at which step the test does not progress or was aborted.

The _Scenario Status_ tab only contains information while the test is actually running or finished. This is an overview of all test scenarios that are executed in this load test, containing scenario name and state and other useful information such as currently running users, average scenario runtime and especially the number of events and errors that occurred in this scenario:

### Create a Report

XTC will automatically download test results and [create a report](../../../load-testing/manual/320-test-evaluation/) at the end of the load test. These will be available in the _Results_ and the _Reports_ tabs. Both will be available as compressed archives ready for download if you need them on your local machine. All generated reports will be available inside XTC to browse and evaluate them, and XTC can also generate a link for public sharing (you can adjust when this link is supposed to expire on creating a share link, or configure this [globally for the whole project](../../010-xtc-basics/#default-sharing-settings)).

While the test is still running you can also generate [intermediate reports](../../../load-testing/manual/320-test-evaluation/#intermediate-results) by clicking _Generate Intermediate Report_ on top of the load test contents.

After the load test has finished, you can create as many custom reports with adjusted report settings as you need. 

#### Custom Reports

On creating a custom report, there will be a popup to configure the report settings: you will be prompted to enter a _label_ and _description_ for the report, and may choose a _time range_ to create the report for (intermediate and final reports always cover the fulfilled testing time). The default time range is always the complete test duration, but you may determine the start time and end time by several options, similar to the [report creation](../../../load-testing/manual/540-report-options/#defining-a-reporting-timeframe) in XLT. To check whether your settings are correct, the effective report time range will be displayed at the end of this section:

{{< image src="xtc/loadtest_report_timerange.png" >}}
Basic settings for creating a new load test report: adjusting the time range.
{{< /image >}}

By clicking **Show Advanced Settings** four more sections will appear:
* _Include/Exclude Patterns_ can be defined either for [test cases](../../../load-testing/manual/540-report-options/#excluding-test-scenarios) or [agents](../../../load-testing/manual/540-report-options/#report-for-a-subset-of-agents),
* in _Report Generator Properties_ you can define completely a [custom report configuration](../../../load-testing/manual/550-report-configuration/),
* in _Merge Rules_ you can override the project's [merge rules](../../../load-testing/advanced/010-merge-rules/) (to avoid unexpected side effects we recommend to paste your complete set of merge rules here, even the ones that may have been already defined in the project), and 
* you can even add _Additional Command Line Arguments_ for report generation (learn more about [report generation by command line](../../../load-testing/manual/540-report-options/)).

These advanced settings are not trivial, so make sure you know what you're doing. 

On clicking **Accept** report creation will be started. The report will appear in the list of reports, showing a little progress icon left to its name. After the report creation has finished, you will be able to click the name to open and [read it](../../../load-testing/manual/320-test-evaluation/#reading-a-test-report).

### Evaluate the Test Run

After the test has finished, you can add a short summary, a rating and a more detailed evaluation to the test in the _Evaluation_ tab. Summary and rating will show up in the load tests overview table then. To enter or edit an evaluation, click the pencil button:
