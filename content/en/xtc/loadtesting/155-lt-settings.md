## Test Settings

The _Settings_ tab contains all settings for the test run. Some of these are mandatory, you need to set them before the test run can be started.

Please note that none of the test settings can be edited after the test was started.

### Load Profile

Under _Load Profile_ you can override the settings in your test suite for the [test properties file to be used]({{< relref "test-suite-configuration#test-properties-file" >}}). In addition to that, you can override the settings for test duration and [load factor]({{< relref "load-configuration#load-factor" >}}). All other settings, for example, [ramp-up times]({{< relref "load-configuration#ramp-up-load-profile" >}}), are not directly configurable in the UI yet, but are still read from the properties files in your test suite.

The load profile settings are only needed if you want to override your test suite settings for some reason, e.g. quickly changing the test duration or load factor without pushing changes to the repository, or switching between your prepared test property files. If the fields are left empty, the settings in the test suite will be used.

When overriding the load profile settings for a particular load test, you must specify a value for each parameter, including the ramp-up and shutdown times. Load Factor formulas are only allowed if ramp up time equals zero. The resulting load curve is shown in a graph next to the settings then:

Learn more in our _Load Testing_ section about [configuring load profiles]({{< relref "load-configuration" >}}) for your test run.

### Properties

In _Properties_ and _Secret Properties_ you may overwrite [properties]({{< relref "test-suite-configuration" >}}) for test execution. Values set here take precedence over the values from the project repository, which are always used as default.

Properties may also be overwritten globally for all load tests of this project in the [project configuration]({{< relref "120-load-project-configuration#properties" >}}).

### Repository

Under _Repository_ you can enter a branch of the project repository to be used for this test run. This is only necessary if you want to use another branch than the one you [configured for the project]({{< relref "../basics/060-project-configuration#repository" >}}). If this is left empty, the project or default branch will be used.

## Machine Configuration

The most important (and mandatory) part of the test setup is the configuration of the test machines to be used. The machines and machine settings to use for a load test can be found in the _**Machines**_ tab.

The machines to be used can be selected from _Amazon Cloud Machines_, _Google Cloud Machines_ or _Hetzner Cloud Machines_ (or you use a combination of these).

If you want to use machines in the _**Amazon/Google/Hetzner Cloud**_, you just enter configuration details and the selected machines will automatically be started prior to the load test and terminated afterwards by XTC. To edit the cloud machine configuration, click the editing button next to the headline. There you can

* specify which _regions_ the machines should run in (you can pick several, the machines will be spread over the selected regions as evenly as possible),
* pick an _instance template_ for your machines, depending on how much computing power you think you'll need,
* select the number of machine instances to start (_instance count_), and
* select the number of _agents per instance_.

As **[test sizing]({{< relref "test-sizing" >}})** is a whole topic in itself, you might want to check the CPU usage after your test and maybe adjust the number of machines for the next test run.

In _**Common Machine Configuration**_ you can enter a password for the communication between the master and all agent machines (a random password will be generated by default). You can also [override the default XLT execution environment version]({{< relref "120-load-project-configuration/#environment" >}}) in this section.

## Notifications

XTC can notify users whenever a load test changes its state.

Here's how you can set up notifications:

* Via **Slack**: To receive Slack notifications, configure the [Slack Integration]({{< relref "../integrations/510-slack" >}}) for your project. XTC will then send updates about the [load test's state]({{< relref "../integrations/510-slack/#load-tests" >}}) (start, finish, error, report available, etc.) directly to the Slack channel you've specified.
* Via **Email**: If you prefer email notifications, go to the _Notifications_ section of the _Settings_ tab on the load test's details page. You can then add a custom list of email addresses that XTC will notify when the load test finishes. To disable notifications again, just clear the address list.
