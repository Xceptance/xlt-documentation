## XTC Load Testing Basics

To run a load test in XTC, we assume you have an [XLT Test Suite](../../../load-testing/manual/060-test-development/) available in the [repository](#define-the-test-suite-repository) of your choice. (For more information on what to prepare and think about before load testing, see our recommendations for a load testing [workflow](../../../load-testing/manual/050-workflow/).)

XTC enables you to quickly get an [overview of previous test runs](../01-features/#view-load-tests-in-xtc), offering plenty of information. 

[Running a load test with XTC](#run-a-load-test) usually consists of the following steps which you can also learn more about in the [load testing documentation](../../../load-testing):

* [create a new load test run](../150-create-lt),
* adjust the [test settings](../155-lt-settings) for this run, 
* [start the load test](../160-start-lt),
* [monitor](../170-monitor-lt) your test while it's running,
* [create test reports](../180-reports) and
* [evaluate](../190-evaluation) the test results.
