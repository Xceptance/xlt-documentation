Now we got you all excited about XTC's [monitoring features](./01-features), let's dive in and set up your monitoring project. 

## How to Set Up Monitoring

{{< TODO >}}To be done...{{< /TODO >}}

To this end, you will need an XTC monitoring project, and ...other stuff, test suite etc, TBD

* Scenarios: Manage the monitoring scenarios of this project. 
    * Scenarios:
    * Add new Scenario:
    * Scenario Defaults:
* Quiet Periods: configure when notifications should not be sent (and scenarios should be disabled, if you want this) - TODO can you schedule quiet periods, like every night between 11pm and 5am or something like this? Or do only dates work in time range (yet)?
* Configuration: Repository/Branch/Auth like in XTC Basics (TODO: branch name as regex??); special settings for monitoring projects are _Data Persistence_ (how long certain data will be persisted, single settings for different types of data) and _Execution Environment_ (IP addresses where monitoring scenarios are running)
