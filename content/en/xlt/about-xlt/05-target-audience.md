XLT was developed by a testing company to provide a tool with greater flexibility and better reporting that enhances the trust in test results. Its power might also be its biggest challenge, as it's not a typical, easy-to-use load testing tool.

## XLT is for you if...
* you are a Software Engineer or a Software Engineer in Test,
* you need detailed data and the ability to post-process it,
* you need strong validation,
* you want to combine performance testing and understanding the application,
* you are looking for a solution you can use in your preferred IDE,
* your tests need to be flexible and predictable,
* the control over data and logic is important.

## XLT might not fit if...
* you need Capture & Replay,
* property files, source code, and version control scare you,
* you are not comfortable with the command line,
* you prefer configuring tests rather than programming a test suite.

## XLT is suitable for... 
* any kind of load and performance test, preferably over HTTP. XLT has also been used for WebSocket, FTP, and [WebDAV testing]({{< relref "40-webdav-test-suite" >}}),
* tests that require many machines and locations,
* your CI/CD setup,
* extensive data processing of results, as XLT provides transparency and allows you to add data sources and capture more data at any time,
* frameworks and setups that go beyond simple URL tests, requiring custom data, custom processing, flexible logic-based flows, and more.

This manual will mention and demonstrate some of these complex load and performance test setups, alongside typical business tests.
