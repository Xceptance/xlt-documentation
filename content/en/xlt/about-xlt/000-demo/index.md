  This page demos several important pieces for the documentation and is meant to support
  anyone who wants to update or extend the documentation. This is not material for XLT.

The following chapters show important pieces how to use this Hugo template for writing the XLT documentation. Please refer always back to the source code and check how each component is written.

> Just a blockquote. You can still use them. They are kinda boring.

## Keyboard
You can reference keyboard keys in text, using the {{< kbd >}}kbd{{< /kbd >}} shortcode.

## Code

### Java Code
#### Plain

```java
import foo;

public class Foo
{
}
```

### Bash Code
```bash
foo@picard $./start.sh
```

----
## Footnotes

```markdown
That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.
```
That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.


## Links

### Any link that is up or down the hierarchy

Go to [Load Testing]({{< relref "/xlt/load-testing" >}}).

Go to [XTC]({{< relref "xtc" >}}).

Go to [Release Notes]({{< relref "../../release-notes" >}}).

(Actually you can build links to wherever in the hierarchy without a shortcode, [just like this](/load-testing) or [this](../../load-testing). However the `relref` shortcode should be preferred as Hugo will perform link validation for all links generated by that shortcode and log a warning or fail the build with an error depending on the [configuration](https://gohugo.io/content-management/cross-references/#ref-and-relref-configuration).)

**Heads up:** the _Release Notes_ section uses a [setting](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#permalinks) to generate permalinks from their title instead of their file name (e.g., the link will be `release-notes\5.7.x` instead of `release-notes\5_7_x`). You can link these either [like this using the relref shortcode]({{< relref "/xlt/release-notes/5_7_x" >}}) or [like this in simple markdown without validation](/xlt/release-notes/5.7.x).

{{% note notitle %}}
Please note that Hugo will _not_ validate anchors used in references (i.e. a link to `/load-testing/mypage#anchor` will only fail if `/load-testing/mypage` can't be found).
{{% /note %}}

### External links
You can build external links by using the [link markdown with complete URLs](https://github.com/Xceptance), Hugo will [take care](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#link-with-title-markdown-example "Shortcode for building external links") to add `target="_blank"` to all outgoing links (starting with http\*). 

## Images
{{< image src="releasenotes/agent-cpu-usage-chart-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/agent-cpu-usage-chart-large.png" >}}
An `image` that gets its source from *src* and is linked to *large* if this is given. Paths are relative to **static/images/**. The *.Inner* part is the caption.
{{< /image >}}

{{< image src="releasenotes/agent-cpu-usage-chart-large.png" >}}
Another image that is not linked to anything. If it is too wide for the window, it will be scaled by CSS (`.img-fluid, .td-content img {max-width: 100%}`). 
{{< /image >}}

{{< image src="user-manual/chart_variable_load_factor.svg" max-width="60%">}}
To just use CSS scaling like above for your large image, but think it looks nicer in the text at less than 100% width, you can just pass a max-width parameter to the shortcode that will be included in the image CSS.
{{< /image >}}

{{< image src="releasenotes/agents-gc-and-cpu-information-small.jpg" large="releasenotes/agents-gc-and-cpu-information-large.png" >}}
Yet another image. Note how neatly you can navigate between the large versions of all images of this page.
{{< /image >}}

{{< imageres src="test.png" >}}
Another image using the `imageres` shortcode, which will resize images to a smaller preview using hugo's image processing. For this, the source image must be part of the page resources (pages are in a folder as index.md, images in same folder). The *.Inner* part is the caption.
{{< /imageres >}}

## Colored Text
Should you need colored text, use {{< ctext color="green" >}}ctext in green{{< /ctext >}} or any other html compatible color code. If none is given, this defaults to {{< ctext >}}grey{{< /ctext >}}.

## XTC Permissions

Several XTC actions require certain user roles to be performed, either in project or organization context. Use this shortcode to quickly add the necessary role:

```
{{%/* permission type="project" role="reader" action="chew gum" */%}}
```

{{% permission type="project" role="reader" action="chew gum" %}}

There is no inner part required for this shortcode. The parameters "type" and "action" are optional, the default looks like this:

```
{{%/* permission role="reader" */%}}
```

{{% permission role="reader"%}}


## TODO
### To-Do Marker
{{< TODO / >}}To remind us that something needs to be done, it introduces a marked TODO at the position of the shortcode `{{</* TODO / */>}}`. TODO markers right now assume to be in the beginning because they make a little room on the right side - "{{< TODO / >}}".

{{< TODO comment="I am more useful!" / >}}Optionally you can pass the parameter comment and provide some more information such as `{{</* TODO comment="More information in the title" / */>}}`.

### Marked Text
```
{{</* TODO */>}}To mark some text use this.{{</* /TODO */>}}
```
{{< TODO >}}To mark some text use this.{{< /TODO >}}


### Markdown in a To-Do
```
{{%/* TODO */%}}To use **markdown** in the to-do, use this.{{%/* /TODO */%}}
```
{{% TODO %}}To use **markdown** in the to-do, use this.{{% /TODO %}}
