    A list of open-source software and components used to build this documentation.

---

Our goal in building new and comprehensive documentation for XLT was to use open-source components. Below is a list of frameworks, fonts, and their respective licenses used to create this documentation.

## Framework

### Hugo

The documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which boasts being "one of the most popular open-source static site generators" and, like XLT, is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). 

### Theme: Docsy

Hugo can be used with predefined or custom themes. We use the [Docsy](https://docsy.dev/) theme as a base and add our CI flavor to it. Docsy is a theme specifically designed for technical documentation sets and is also licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Fonts

### Roboto and Ubuntu Mono

The fonts used in this documentation are Roboto and Ubuntu Mono, both originally part of the [Google Fonts project](https://github.com/google/fonts) but hosted on our own servers. Roboto is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), while Ubuntu Mono uses the [Ubuntu Font License](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ufl/ubuntumono/LICENCE.txt).

## JavaScript

### Search: Algolia DocSearch

The documentation search uses [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/), which is free for technical documentation websites of open-source projects and is licensed under an [MIT license](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/next/LICENSE). You can learn more about their **privacy policy** [here](https://www.algolia.com/policies/privacy/).

### Image Viewer: Lightbox

To display images effectively, we use [Lightbox](https://victordiego.com/lightbox/) by Victor Diego, which is licensed under the [MIT license](https://victordieggo.mit-license.org/).

### Other JavaScript Libraries

Other JavaScript libraries used by this documentation (hosted on our own servers) include: 
* Bootstrap ([MIT license](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/LICENSE)),
* jQuery ([MIT license](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)),
* Popper ([MIT license](https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui)).
