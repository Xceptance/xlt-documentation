XLT (Xceptance LoadTest) is a multi-purpose load and performance testing tool that can also be used for test automation. Its test automation supports WebDriver-style automation while adding additional features. Load testing and test automation capabilities together allow you to run client-side performance tests. This means you can use a real browser to run performance tests at scale, rather than manually building all the calls.

XLT is powered by Java, allowing it to run almost everywhere. Java also enables you to program your scripts, rather than merely configuring them. This gives you the power of a full programming language, and you can use almost any Java library as part of XLT.

This section of the documentation provides a high-level introduction. It discusses features and functionalities, and points you to how-to guides and manual sections for further details.
