XLT (Xceptance Load Test) is a multi-purpose load and performance test tool with the ability to be used for test automation too. The test automation supports WebDriver-style automation but adds features to it. Load testing and test automation together permit you to run client performance testing. That means, you can use a real browser to run a performance test at scale rather than trying to build all the calls manually.

XLT is powered by Java and hence it runs almost everywhere. Java also enables you to program your scripts rather than just configuring them. That gives you the power of a full programming language at your disposal and of course, you can use almost any Java library as part of XLT.

This section of the documentation will give you a big picture introduction. It talks about features and functionalities as well as points you to how-tos and sections in the manual for further details.
