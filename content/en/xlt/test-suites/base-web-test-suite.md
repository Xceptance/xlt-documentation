## Introduction

The **[Posters Simple Load Test Suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-simple-loadtest-suite)** is designed as a minimal entry point to help you get started with XLT. It provides a straightforward way to learn the fundamental concepts of XLT and load testing without the complexity of a full-scale framework.

This suite targets our demo application, the **[Posters Shop]({{< relref "../quick-start/demo-application" >}})**, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) and included in the `samples` directory of the XLT distribution.

While this suite is an excellent starting point for beginners, real-world projects often benefit from more advanced structures. Once you assume confidence with the basics, we recommend exploring our more complex options.
