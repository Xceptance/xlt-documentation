## XLT 9.0.0

Version 9 is a major release of XLT. It comes with many new features, but also some incompatible changes. See below for an overview of what's in the box.

Due to API changes in XLT 8, you may need to migrate your test suites for use with this new version. Please read the Test Suite Migration section carefully.


### Overview

#### Framework

XLT is now based on Java 21. This will allow us to take advantage of exciting new features such as virtual threads. This means that to run tests with XLT you will need a Java 21 runtime environment installed.

The `XltProperties` class now provides new methods to obtain the config directory and the data directory in your test suite. You will need them if your test suite adds custom features with    

```java
Path configDir = XltProperties.getInstance().getConfigDirectory();
Path dataDir = XltProperties.getInstance().getDataDirectory();
```

#### Load Testing

>>> Download of results fails when load test has no test properties file configured

`ec2_admin`, our tool to manage machine instances in AWS, has been extended to support *temporary* access credentials, which typically come into play if your account requires 2FA. As usual, you can configure temporary access credentials in `<xlt>/config/ec2_admin.properties`:

```
aws.accessKey = <your temporary access key>
aws.secretKey = <your temporary secret key>
aws.sessionToken = <your session token>
```

But note that access credentials may now also be taken from the user's profile directory or from environment variables. Consult the AWS documentation for more details.

#### Load Test Report

The *Load Profile* section now shows the share of each configured sceanrio in the total load, both as a percentage value and a graphical bar.

There is now a *Slowest Requests* report page that lists the top-most slowest requests in your load test with many details. By default, the page lists up to 500 requests, with a limit of 20 requests per request name. To count as a slow request, the runtime of a request must be between 3 seconds and 10 minutes. Note that all of these values can be reconfigured in the report generator configuration.

#### XLT Images

Xceptance provides ready-to-use public XLT images for AWS and Docker. The images are based on Debian 12.x ("bookworm"). They now include the latest XLT and JDK 21 and are tuned for load testing. For real browser load testing, they also include the latest Chromium and Firefox (ESR) browsers with matching web driver binaries, `chromedriver` and `geckodriver`.

If you are looking for XLT images for other clouds, visit XLT's sister project, [XLT Packer](https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT-Packer/). This project not only contains scripts to install and set up the contents of an XLT image, but also provides Packer templates to actually create such images for the following clouds:

* AWS
* DigitalOcean
* Google
* Hetzner

Follow the instructions in the README file to create an XLT image for one of the supported clouds yourself.


### Test Suite Migration

As mentioned above, XLT 9.x comes with breaking changes. To migrate your test suites, you must complete the following steps.

#### 1. Update the Java Version

Update the Java version in your build files (such as `pom.xml`) and the project files of your favorite IDE to be Java 21.

#### 2. Fix Compile Errors

Since we have updated HtmlUnit and Selenium, but also many other helper libaries to their latest version, there might be incompatible API changes. In our test suites, we haven't encountered such changes yet. If you come across some changes, please let us know and we will list them here.

#### 3. Test Your Scenarios

Now it's time to verify that everything still works as before. Start by running the test scenarios from your IDE. They should run and finish with the expected results. Then run a small load test. Check the results and the output in all log files.

#### 4. Review the Report Generator Configuration

As mentioned above, the XLT report generator has learned some new features. You can configure them in the `<xlt>/config/reportgenerator.properties' file. Below are the properties for the slowest request feature:

```
## The maximum number of slow requests to remember per request bucket.
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.slowestRequests.requestsPerBucket = 20

## The maximum number of slow requests to show in the report.
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.slowestRequests.totalRequests = 500

## The minimum runtime (in ms) a request must reach to be remembered as a slow request.
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.slowestRequests.minRuntime = 3000

## The maximum runtime (in ms) a request can reach to be remembered as a slow request.
com.xceptance.xlt.reportgenerator.slowestRequests.maxRuntime = 600000
```

Check the defaults to see if they work for you, and adjust them if necessary.
