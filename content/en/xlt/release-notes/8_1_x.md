## XLT 8.1.0

### Load Test Report

Charts in the load test report now display a crosshair when you move the mouse over them. The crosshair is intended to be a visual tool to easily relate an interesting part of a series to time and value. In addition, the horizontal line can help identify small degradations or improvements that would otherwise go unnoticed.

### Framework

The library `neko-htmlunit` has been updated to version 3.11.3. This version fixes an occasional problem with HTML parsing that caused parts of the DOM tree to be missing.
