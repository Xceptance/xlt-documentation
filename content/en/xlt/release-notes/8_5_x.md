## XLT 8.5.0

### Framework

* Selenium has been updated to version 4.26.0 to provide better support for newer browsers.
* After calling `XltWebClient.reset()` in a test scenario, the scenario continued to run successfully, but XLT stopped recording measurements for requests in the `timers.csv` file. This is now fixed.


### Load Testing

* The Load Test Report now includes a new chart in the *Response Codes* section. This chart visualizes the number and distribution of HTTP response codes over time.
