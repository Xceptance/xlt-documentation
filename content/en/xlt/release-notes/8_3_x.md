## XLT 8.3.0

#### Load Test Report

Starting with XLT 8.3.0, load and performance test reports are optionally enriched with a new section named "Scorecard" that in fact is the result of XLT's new "Scorecard" feature - a rule-based approach to evaluate a load test report and rate it in an automated fashion.

It works by applying XPath expressions on the load test report's XML document and testing their value for some given condition. Furthermore, it allows you to weight certain aspects of your checks by assigning points to them that are summed up to a final score later on.
Last but not least, you may assign a rating for the load test depending on the final score.

All of this enables you to test for certain performance or even functional criteria in an automated fashion to get a first insight into the load test's outcome and thus save valuable time.

Sounds interesting? [Read more]({{<ref "../load-testing/manual/570-scorecard/">}}) about this feature in XLT's User Manual.
