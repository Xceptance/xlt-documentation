## Introduction
The XLT plug-in for Jenkins allows to configure certain criteria that
must be met by the generated report. This useful feature would also make
sense for difference or trend reports. This way, you would be able to
check for criteria based on how certain values evolved over time or how
much they differ compared to a given baseline.  
Last but not least, this feature should not be restricted to Jenkins
users but work in any environment supported by XLT.

We therefore came to the conclusion to provide a stand-alone tool for
this purpose that is able to handle all kind of reports generated by
XLT.

## Approach
To keep things simple, we decided to use XPath expressions that are
evaluated on the parsed XML document to define whether a given criterion
is met. These expressions must evaluate to a boolean result (e.g.
`count(/some/element) > 0`), otherwise it is seen as an error (same as
for invalid XPath expressions).

All criteria that should be validated by the tool are defined in a
single file - the criteria definition file - which is pure JSON and
looks like this:

```json 
{
    "criteria": [  
    {  
        "id": "MaxRequestRuntime",  
        "enabled": true,  
        "condition": "count(//request/max/relativeDifference[number() > 10 ]) = 0",  
        "message": "Maximum request runtime exceeded 10%"  
    },  
    {  
        "id": "P95RequestRuntime",  
        "enabled": true,  
        "condition": "not(//request/percentiles/p95/absoluteDifference[number()>1000])",  
        "message": "Request runtime (P95) increased by more than 1 second"  
    },  
    {  
        "id": "NoRequestErrors",  
        "enabled": true,  
        "condition": "not(//request/errors/*[number() > 0]",  
        "message": "Erroneous requests encountered"  
    }  
    ]  
}
```

Each criterion listed in the array `criteria` is an object with
following properties:

-   id - The ID of the criterion (required; non-blank and unique)
-   condition - The criterion’s condition as XPath expression (required;
    non-blank)
-   enabled - Whether or not the criterion is enabled (optional;
    defaults to `true`)
-   message - Failure message (optional)

The output generated by the tool is pure JSON as well and contains the
following:

-   used/defined criteria
-   validation status (and failure/error message) of each criterion
-   summary per document
-   name of validated document (as the number of validated documents is
    potentially greater than 1)

## Usage
To use the tool, open a terminal window and execute the following
command sequence:

```sh
cd <XLT>/bin  
./check_criteria.sh -c /path/to/criteria.json /path/to/report.xml
```
{{% alert title="Information" color="info" %}}
Windows users have to use the appropriate `.cmd` file located in the same directory.
{{% /alert %}}

The tool is able to process more than one XML file in one pass. Simply
specify the path of each file as additional argument:

bc(bash). cd <XLT>/bin  
./check\_criteria.sh -c /path/to/criteria.json /path/to/report1.xml
/path/to/report2.xml …

Per default, the output will be written to standard-out but the tool
also offers an option to write it to a file of your choice.

bc(bash). cd <XLT>/bin  
./check\_criteria.sh -c /path/to/criteria.json -o
/path/to/validation\_output.json /path/to/report.xml

Sample output:

bc(json). {  
"criteria": \[  
{  
"id": "MaxRequestRuntime",  
"enabled": true,  
"condition":
"count(//request/max/relativeDifference\[number()\>10\])=0",  
"message": "Maximum request runtime exceeded 10%"  
},  
{  
"id": "P95RequestRuntime",  
"enabled": true,  
"condition":
"not(//request/percentiles/p95/absoluteDifference\[number()\>1000\])",  
"message": "Request runtime (P95) increased by more than 1 second"  
},  
{  
"id": "NoRequestErrors",  
"enabled": true,  
"condition": "not(//request/errors/\*\[number() \> 0\]",  
"message": "Errorneous requests encountered"  
}  
\],  
"checks": \[  
{  
"document": "foo/bar/bumm",  
"total": {  
"passed": 1,  
"failed": 1,  
"skipped": 0,  
"error": 1  
},  
"details": {  
"MaxRequestRuntime": { "status": "failed", "message": "Maximum request
runtime exceeded 10%" },  
"P95RequestRuntime": { "status": "passed" },  
"NoRequestErrors": { "status": "error", "message": "Invalid XPath
expression" }  
}  
}  
\]  
}

### Status Codes

Similar as the other tools shipped with XLT, the criteria validation
tool returns one of the following status codes:

-   0 on success
-   1 if one of its input files or the criteria definition file could
    not be parsed
-   2 if a required argument is missing or some of the given arguments
    are invalid
-   3 if a criterion is not met or could not be evaluated (caused an
    error)
