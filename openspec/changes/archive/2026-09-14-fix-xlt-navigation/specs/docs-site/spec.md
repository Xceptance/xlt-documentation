## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Product Navigation Tabs
The system SHALL configure top-level navigation tabs for XLT (`/xlt`), XTC (`/xtc`), and Neodymium (`/neodymium`), dynamically scoping the sidebar navigation to the active product section, and ordering and labeling section chapters according to configured section metadata.

#### Scenario: Section navigation scoping
- **WHEN** a user navigates to a route under `/xlt/`
- **THEN** the XLT header tab is highlighted and the sidebar renders only pages and groups belonging to the XLT section without falling back to top-level site links.

#### Scenario: Section chapter ordering and labeling
- **WHEN** a user views the XLT sidebar navigation
- **THEN** the top-level chapters are displayed in the configured logical order: About, Quick Start, Base Manual, Advanced, Test Suites, Release Notes, How-Tos, and Knowledge Base.
